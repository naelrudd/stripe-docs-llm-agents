# Build a checkout page with the Checkout Sessions API

Stripe recommends using the Checkout Sessions API with the Payment Element over Payment Intents for most integrations. Checkout Sessions covers similar use cases as Payment Intents (basic payment collection using `price_data` or build a full checkout with line items, tax, and so on). Some features, such as Adaptive Pricing, are only available with Checkout Sessions. Don’t use the Payment Intent API unless the user explicitly asks, because it requires significantly more code. Learn more about Elements with the Checkout Sessions API: https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart-checkout-sessions. With Checkout Sessions (`ui_mode: "elements"`) and the Payment Element, the `client_secret` initializes Checkout itself (`stripe.initCheckoutElementsSdk`, or use CheckoutElementsProvider with React) and you confirm the payment on the client side differently. If using React, make sure you import from `@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout`, use `CheckoutElementsProvider` with the client secret, and confirm using `checkout.confirm`. If using HTML, make sure you use `checkout = stripe.initCheckoutElementsSdk({clientSecret: promise}); checkout.createPaymentElement(); paymentElement = checkout.createPaymentElement(); paymentElement.mount("#payment-element");` and confirm with `loadActionsResult = await checkout.loadActions(); actions = loadActionsResult.actions; error = await actions.confirm();`.

Coding agents should install the Stripe CLI (`npm i -g @stripe/cli`) and run the command `stripe sandbox create --help` to provision an anonymous Stripe sandbox with working API keys. No account registration required.

### Create a Checkout Session

Add an endpoint on your server that creates a *Checkout Session* (A Checkout Session represents your customer's session as they pay for one-time purchases or subscriptions through Checkout. After a successful payment, the Checkout Session contains a reference to the Customer, and either the successful PaymentIntent or an active Subscription), setting the [ui_mode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-ui_mode) to `elements`. You must create the Checkout Session server-side because it requires your [secret or restricted API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys), which you can’t safely expose in client-side code.

The Checkout Session response includes a [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-client_secret), which the client uses to complete the payment. Return the client secret in your response.

### Supply a return URL

To define where Stripe redirects your customer after payment, specify the URL of the return page in the [return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-return_url) parameter when creating the Checkout Session. After the payment attempt, Stripe redirects your customer to the return page hosted on your website.

Include the `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` template variable in the URL. Before redirecting your customer, Checkout replaces the variable with the Checkout Session ID. You’re responsible for creating and hosting the return page on your website.

### Define a product to sell

Define the [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices.md) for your Checkout Session. Typically, that means using a predefined product [Price ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-line_items-price). However, if you need dynamic pricing that can’t be known ahead of time, use [price_data](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-line_items-price_data) to define prices inline.

### Handle different transaction types

To handle different transaction types, adjust the [mode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-mode) parameter:

- For one-time payments, use `payment`.
- If you have one or more [recurring prices](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/subscriptions.md), use `subscription`.
- If you aren’t collecting an initial payment from a customer but want to save their payment details to [charge them later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/save-and-reuse.md?payment-ui=embedded-components), use `setup`.

### Add Stripe to your React app

To stay *PCI-compliant* (Any party involved in processing, transmitting, or storing credit card data must comply with the rules specified in the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. PCI compliance is a shared responsibility and applies to both Stripe and your business) by ensuring that payment details go directly to Stripe and never reach your server, install [React Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md).

```bash
npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```

### Load Stripe.js

To configure the Stripe library, call `loadStripe()` with your Stripe publishable API key.

### Load Stripe.js

Use *Stripe.js* (Use Stripe.js’ APIs to tokenize customer information, collect sensitive card data, and accept payments with browser payment APIs) to remain *PCI compliant* (Any party involved in processing, transmitting, or storing credit card data must comply with the rules specified in the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. PCI compliance is a shared responsibility and applies to both Stripe and your business) by sending payment details directly to Stripe without hitting your server. Always load Stripe.js from *js.stripe.com* to remain compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host it yourself.

You can load Stripe.js by including the script in your HTML file or using [loadStripe](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js/blob/master/README.md#loadstripe).

### Define the payment form

To securely collect the customer’s information, create empty placeholder `div` elements. Stripe injects iframes into each `div`.

### Initialize Stripe.js

Initialize Stripe.js with your [publishable API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys).

### Fetch a Checkout Session client secret

Make a request to your server to [create a Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md) and retrieve the client secret.

### Initialize Checkout

Use `clientSecret` to initialize Checkout, passing a client secret string or a Promise that resolves to it. The [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout) object forms the backbone of your checkout page and contains data from the Checkout Session and methods to update it.

### Initialize Checkout

Render the [CheckoutElementsProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/checkout_provider), passing `clientSecret`—the client secret string or Promise that resolves to the client secret.

### Set up the state

Initialize some state to keep track of the payment, show errors, and manage the user interface.

### Store a reference to Checkout

Access the [checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout) object in your CheckoutForm component by using the `useCheckoutElements()` hook. The `checkout` object acts as the backbone of your checkout page, containing data from the Checkout Session and methods to update it.

### Collect the customer’s email address

Use the [Contact Details Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/create_contact_details_element) to collect your customer’s email address. It handles email collection and validation for you, and helps customers sign in to Link.

Alternatively, you can skip this step if you provide the customer’s email in one of the following ways:

- Pass in [customer_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_email) or [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer) when creating the Checkout Session. Stripe validates emails provided this way.
  - These prefill the session with an email that customers can’t edit on the checkout page. If you want to prefill with an editable email, use [defaultValues.email](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/init#custom_checkout_init-options-defaultValues-email) when initializing Checkout.
- Pass in an email you already validated on [updateEmail](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/update_email) or [checkout.confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/confirm).

### Collect the customer’s email address

Use the [ContactDetailsElement](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/contact_details_element) to collect your customer’s email address. It handles email collection and validation for you, and helps customers sign in to Link.

Alternatively, you can skip this step if you provide the customer’s email in one of the following ways:

- Pass in [customer_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_email) or [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer) when creating the Checkout Session. Stripe validates emails provided this way.
  - These prefill the session with an email that customers can’t edit on the checkout page. If you want to prefill with an editable email, use [defaultValues.email](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/init#custom_checkout_init-options-defaultValues-email) when initializing Checkout.
- Pass in an email you already validated on [updateEmail](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/update_email) or [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/confirm).

### Add the Payment Element

Add the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/create_payment_element) to your payment form. It embeds an iframe with a dynamic form that collects payment details for a variety of payment methods. Your customer can pick a payment method type, and the form automatically collects all necessary payments details for their selection.

### Create the Payment Element

Create a [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/create_payment_element) and mount it to the placeholder `<div>` in your payment form. This embeds an iframe with a dynamic form that displays configured payment method types, allowing your customer to select a payment method. The form automatically collects the associated payment details for the selected payment method type.

### (Optional) Style the Payment Element

Customize the Payment Element UI by creating an [Appearance object](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md) and passing it as an option to the CheckoutElementsProvider. Use your company’s color scheme and font to make it match with the rest of your checkout page. Use custom fonts (for example, from Google Fonts) by initializing Checkout with a [font set](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/checkout_provider#react_checkout_provider-options-elementsOptions-fonts).

Make sure to open the preview on the right to see your changes live.

Parts of this preview demo might not match your actual checkout page. These settings represent only a subset of the [Appearance object’s](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/appearance.md?payment-ui=embedded-components) variables, and the [Appearance object](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/appearance.md?payment-ui=embedded-components) only controls certain attributes of Stripe Elements. You’re responsible for styling the rest of your checkout page.

Customize the Payment Element UI by creating an [Appearance object](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md) and initializing Checkout with it. Use your company’s color scheme and font to make it match with the rest of your checkout page. Use custom fonts (for example, from Google Fonts) by initializing Checkout with a [font set](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/init#custom_checkout_init-options-elementsOptions-fonts).

You’re responsible for styling the rest of your checkout page.

### Handle the submit event

Listen to the form’s submit event to know when to confirm the payment through the Stripe API.

### Complete the payment

Call [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/confirm) when the customer is ready to complete checkout, such as in response to clicking a pay button.

### Handle errors

If there are any immediate [errors](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes.md) (for example, your customer’s card is declined), Stripe.js returns an error. Show that error message to your customer so they can try again.

### Create an endpoint to retrieve a Checkout Session

Add an endpoint to retrieve a Checkout Session status.

### Add a return page

To display order information to your customer, create a return page for the URL you provided as the Checkout Session `return_url`. Stripe redirects to this page after the customer completes the checkout.

### Add a return component

To display order information to your customer, add a new route and return component for the URL you provided as the Checkout Session `return_url`. Stripe redirects to this page after the customer completes the checkout.

### Retrieve a Checkout session

As soon as your return page loads, immediately make a request to the endpoint on your server. Use the Checkout Session ID in the URL to retrieve the status of the Checkout Session.

### Handle session

Handle the result of the session by using its status:

- `complete`: The payment succeeded. Use the information from the Checkout Session to render a success page.
- `open`: The payment failed or was canceled. Remount Checkout so that your customer can try again.

### Run the application

Start your server and go to <http://localhost:4242/checkout.html>.

### Run the application

Start your server and go to <http://localhost:3000/checkout>.

### Run the server application

Start your server.

### Run the client application

Start your React app and go to <http://localhost:3000/checkout>.

```bash
npm start
```

### Try it out

Click the pay button to complete the payment, which redirects you to the specified return page.

If you see the return page, and the payment in the list of [successful payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments?status%5B0%5D=successful) in the Dashboard, your integration is successfully working. Use any of the following test cards to simulate a payment:

| Scenario | Card Number |
| --- | --- |
| Payment succeeds | 4242424242424242 |
| Payment requires 3DS authentication | 4000002500003155 |
| Payment is declined | 4000000000009995 |

To learn more, see [Testing](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md).

## Congratulations! 

You have a basic Checkout integration working. Now learn how to customize the appearance of your checkout page, automate tax collection, create customers, save payment methods, and localize currencies.

### Activate additional features

Use [Checkout Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md) to activate additional features, like collecting addresses and prefilling customer data.

### Prefill customer data

You can prefill the customer’s email address in two ways:

- **Immutable prefill**: Pass [customer_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_email), [customer_account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_account) (a customer-configured `Account` ID), or [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer) (a `Customer` ID) when creating the Checkout Session. These prefill the session with an email that customers can’t edit on the checkout page, so you can omit the Contact Details Element from your form if you want. Learn more about the [difference between using Customers and Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/accounts-v2/use-accounts-as-customers.md).
- **Mutable prefill**: Pass [defaultValues.email](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/init#custom_checkout_init-options-defaultValues-email) when initializing Checkout. This prefills the email field with a value that customers can edit on the checkout page. Use this for scenarios where the customer provided an email earlier in your flow but might want to change it during checkout.

### Require billing and shipping details

Use [billing_address_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-billing_address_collection) and [shipping_address_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection) to require your customer’s address. [shipping_address_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection) requires a list of `allowed_countries`, which Checkout displays in a dropdown menu on the page. The sample uses `US` and `CA` as an example. Replace these values with the two-letter ISO country codes for the countries you ship to.

### Collect billing and shipping details

Use the Address Element to collect your customer’s address.

### Automate tax collection

Calculate and collect the right amount of tax on your Stripe transactions. Learn more about [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax.md) and [how to add it to Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout.md).

### Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard

[Activate Stripe Tax](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax/activate) to monitor your tax obligations, automatically collect tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.

### Add the automatic tax parameter

Set the `automatic_tax` parameter to `enabled: true`.

### Collect billing details

Use the Address Element to collect your customer’s address.

### Create a customer during checkout

Create a customer for each Checkout Session to track payment history, associate purchases, and prefill fields for them. Learn more about [managing customers](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management.md).

### Add the customer creation parameter

Set the `customer_creation` parameter to `always` to create a new customer for each completed Checkout Session.

### Specify returning customers

To associate a Checkout Session with a customer that already exists, provide the [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer) when creating a session. If you model customers using Accounts v2, you can also pass an Account ID to the [customer_account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_account) field to prefill the associated email address. Learn more about the [difference between using v1 Customers and v2 Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/accounts-v2/use-accounts-as-customers.md).

### Save a customer’s payment method

Allow a customer to save their payment method during checkout for future purchases. Learn more about [saving payment methods during payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment.md).

### Add saved payment method parameters

Set `payment_method_save` to `enabled` in `saved_payment_method_options`. You must either provide the ID of an existing customer (in [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer) if using `Customer` objects, [customer_account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_account) if using customer-configured `Account` objects) or set [customer_creation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_creation) to `always`.

### Localize currencies

Adaptive Pricing lets your customers pay in their local currency in more than 150 countries.

### Enable Adaptive Pricing

[Enable Adaptive Pricing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/adaptive-pricing) in your Dashboard settings.

### Localize and format prices

Display localized and formatted amounts from the [Session object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object).

### Localize and format prices

Display localized and formatted amounts from the [useCheckoutElements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/use_checkout_elements) hook.

### Render the Currency Selector Element

Mount the Currency Selector Element to give your customer a choice of currencies and disclose the exchange rate.

### Mark your integration ready for Adaptive Pricing

Set the `adaptivePricing.allowed` parameter to `true`.
