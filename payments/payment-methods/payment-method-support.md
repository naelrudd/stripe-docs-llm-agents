# Payment method support

Learn how your integration choices affect payment method support.

[Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link.md) is a payment method network. With Link, users save their payment details one time, and can use them for future purchases at any business on the Link network.

Payment methods support certain currencies, countries, products, and API options. Make sure your chosen payment methods work for your scenario before choosing an [integration option](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options.md) by viewing these tables:

- [Country and currency support](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md#country-currency-support)
- [Product support](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md#product-support)
- [API support](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md#additional-api-supportability)

All payment methods have specific requirements for their use and might contain additional restrictions that you must comply with, such as marketing guidelines, additional prohibited and restricted businesses, and information about handling disputes and refunds. These usage requirements and restrictions are described in the [documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview.md) for that payment method or in the applicable [payment terms](https://stripe.com/payment-terms/legal).

## Troubleshoot a payment method

If a customer doesn’t see a specific payment method, follow [these steps](https://support.stripe.com/questions/troubleshoot-missing-payment-methods) to troubleshoot the issue using the [Dashboard payment method troubleshooting tool](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods/review).

## Country and currency support 

Refer to the following table to see where each [payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object.md#payment_method_object-type) is supported and what presentment currencies it accepts. This table contains all of the supported currencies and countries for a given payment method. In some cases, not all of the countries listed can accept payments in all of the listed presentment currencies. For more details on exactly what currencies are accepted, see the individual payment method’s page.

> #### Connected accounts
> 
> If you have a platform or marketplace integration that uses Connect, your connected accounts might have different eligibility requirements than your account. To learn about connected account eligibility and capabilities, see [Adding payment method capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payment-methods.md).
