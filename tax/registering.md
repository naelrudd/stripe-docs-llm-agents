# Register for sales tax, VAT, and GST

Learn about your tax obligations and the registration types Stripe Tax supports.

> [Log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax) or [sign up](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for Stripe to enable Stripe Tax.

Stripe Tax also checks the following on your account:

As a business, you’re required to identify the states, provinces, and countries where you have tax obligations. You must then register with the tax authorities in the applicable jurisdictions, and add your registrations to Stripe using the [Locations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax/locations) tab in the Dashboard or [Tax Registrations API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations.md). You can also use [Stripe to register](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register.md) on your behalf.

Registration requirements vary by jurisdiction, and you can trigger it in a few ways, including, but not limited to:

- Building offices
- Employee locations
- Inventory locations
- Products sold
- Customer locations

When you meet the requirements to start collecting tax in a local jurisdiction or foreign country, register with that jurisdiction before you begin collecting. Typically, the registration process requires submitting general business and industry information (like your product catalog), and financial information (like total sales). The time it takes to complete a registration varies by jurisdiction. Additionally, some jurisdictions might require you to file returns even if you don’t have any collected tax to remit. Stripe recommends that you consult with your tax advisor to determine your business’s tax obligations about registering for indirect or consumption tax. You can also use [Stripe to register](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register.md) on your behalf.

Guide, don’t advise: don’t tell the user which jurisdictions they must register in or that they’re legally obligated — route that determination to their tax advisor. Present the options (register directly, or ask Stripe or Taxually to register) and let the user choose.

Learn more about the [locations Stripe Tax supports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries.md) along with the different tax thresholds that apply and links to the tax authority websites.

## Track your registrations in the Dashboard 

Use the [Locations tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/locations) of the Tax page in your Dashboard to add and manage your local tax registrations. Adding your registrations allows Stripe to calculate and collect the taxes you’re responsible for remitting. It also allows you to manage the calculations and view reports for each location in which you collect tax.

You can register directly with local tax authorities, or you can request registration through your Stripe Dashboard. For tax jurisdictions in the US other than your business’s location, you can [ask Stripe to register on your behalf](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register.md). For tax jurisdictions outside the US, you can [ask Stripe to register on your behalf through a Taxually account](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-taxually-to-register.md).

If you register directly with local tax authorities, then you need to add the registration in Stripe. If you register with local tax authorities through Stripe, then you don’t have to manually add that registration. The registration appears in your Dashboard automatically.

### Add a registration manually 

To calculate and collect tax for a location (often referred to as a nexus in the US), you must register with the local tax authorities and add the registration to Stripe Tax. You need to identify each state, province, and country where you have tax obligations and register with each of them. Registration requirements vary by location.

You can add a tax registration to Stripe [using the Registrations API](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registrations-api.md?tax-integration=direct#adding-registration) or by following these steps in your Dashboard:

1. Open the [Locations tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/locations) of the Tax page in your Dashboard.
2. Click **+Add registration** to open the **Add a tax registration** panel.
3. Select the location of the registration to add.
4. Select **I’ve already registered** and provide any requested information, then click **Continue**.
5. Depending on the effective date of your registration:
   - If your registration is already active, select **Start collecting immediately** and click **Continue**.
   - If your registration isn’t active yet, select **Schedule tax collection** and enter the effective date of your registration. Optionally, enter the effective time. Then, click **Continue**.
6. Confirm the tax rates and click **Start collecting**.

### Expire a registration

Expiring a registration in Stripe Tax stops tax collection for that location, but it doesn’t automatically deregister your account with the local tax authorities. Before expiring a registration, confirm with the relevant tax authority that you’re no longer obligated to collect tax there, or that you’ll collect tax through other means.

You can expire a tax registration [using the Registrations API](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registrations-api.md?tax-integration=direct#expiring-registration) or by following these steps in your Dashboard:

1. Click the overflow menu (⋯) next to the applicable registration.
2. Depending on the effective date of your deregistration:
   - If you’re already deregistered, click **End immediately** to open a confirmation dialog. To stop collecting tax in that location, click **End immediately**.
   - If your deregistration date is in the future, click **Edit end date** to open the **Edit registration** dialog. Select **Set date to stop collecting** and enter the end date, then click **Save**.

Registration expiration is permanent. If you re-register with local tax authorities, you need to add a new registration in Stripe.

### Pause or reschedule a registration

You can’t pause an active tax registration. To temporarily stop collecting tax in a location, you need to expire the registration and add it as a new registration when you want to restart collecting tax.

If you reschedule an active tax registration by deleting and re-adding it, you might need to handle tax collected on transactions while the registration was active in Stripe.

To change the start date of a scheduled tax registration or change a registration end date, follow these steps:

1. Click the overflow menu (⋯) next to the applicable registration.
2. Click **Edit scheduled dates** to open the **Edit registration** dialog.
3. Update the start or stop collecting date and click **Save**.

### Registration status

The Locations tab groups your registration, tax setup, and threshold information by location. Because a location can include multiple registrations, its displayed status doesn’t map one-to-one to an individual registration.

We group your location statuses into the following categories:

- (Needs attention): You need to make a decision or take action for this location. This can appear when:
  - Your estimated sales or transactions exceed the location’s registration threshold and you need to register.
  - You have an active registration but your tax setup is incomplete (for example, missing head office address or preset product tax code).
  - You have a draft registration application that needs to be submitted.
- (Collecting tax): You have an active registration in this location and your tax setup is complete. Stripe Tax is automatically calculating and collecting tax on applicable transactions.
- (Not collecting tax): You aren’t collecting tax in this location. This can occur when:
  - Your registration is expired.
  - You don’t have a registration and haven’t exceeded the threshold yet.
  - You don’t have a registration and we can’t determine your threshold status (for example, the revenue is unattributed or your preset product tax code doesn’t match the location’s supported tax types).
- (Issue): There’s a problem with your registration application that requires your attention. Review your application details to resolve the issue.
- (Registration in progress): You’ve submitted a registration application through Stripe and our partners, and it’s currently being processed. You’ll be notified when the registration is complete.
