# Compliance disclosures

Embed Treasury and Issuing disclosure components directly on your website.

Use Stripe’s disclosure components to display current compliance information for your Treasury and Issuing programs.

## Treasury disclosure component

You can embed the Treasury disclosure component directly on your website to automatically display currently [compliant](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/connect/compliance.md) disclosure information without requiring future code changes. Stripe updates the content rendered by the component to reflect legislation and banking partner updates.

### Create and mount the Treasury disclosure component

#### HTML + JS

To embed the disclosure component, you need to include [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js/including) on your website.

1. Add the Stripe.js script onto your page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file:

   ```html
   <script src="https://js.stripe.com/dahlia/stripe.js"></script>
   ```

2. Create a placeholder element on your page where you want to mount the Treasury disclosure element:

   ```html
   <div id="financial-account-disclosure"></div>
   ```

3. On pages that mention Treasury on your site, include the following code to create an instance of Stripe.js and mount the Treasury disclosure element:

   ```javascript
   const stripe = Stripe('<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>');
   
   const options = {
     businessName: 'Your Business Name',
     learnMoreLink: 'https://docs.stripe.com/financial-accounts/connect',
   };
   const {htmlElement: financialAccountDisclosure, error} =
     await stripe.createFinancialAccountDisclosure(options);
   
   if (error) {
     // Handle the error in any way you see fit.
     console.error(error);
   } else {
     document
       .getElementById('financial-account-disclosure')
       .appendChild(financialAccountDisclosure);
   }
   ```

| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `businessName`  | (optional) `string`

     The name of your business as you want it to appear in the disclosure text.                                                                         | The name of your business as it appears on Stripe |
| `learnMoreLink` | (optional) `string`

   **Component styling**

   The HTML element we render contains `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<a>` tags. You can target the `financial-account-disclosure` ID attribute to style the inner elements to match the other content on your webpage.

#### React

To embed the disclosure component, you need to include [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js/including) on your website.

1. Install [React Stripe.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/react-stripe-js) and the [Stripe.js loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/stripe-js) from the npm public registry.

   ```bash
   npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
   ```

2. On pages that mention Treasury on your site, include the `FinancialAccountDisclosure` component:

   ```jsx
   import {FinancialAccountDisclosure} from '@stripe/react-stripe-js';
   import {loadStripe} from '@stripe/stripe-js';
   
   const stripe = loadStripe('<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>');
   {/* ... */}
   <FinancialAccountDisclosure
     stripe={stripe}
     options={{
       businessName: 'Your Business Name',
       learnMoreLink: 'https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/connect',
     }}
   />

| `onError`       | (optional) `(error: Object) => void`

     Triggered when the component fails to load.                                                                                       | None                                              |

   **Component styling**

   The React component we render contains `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<a>` tags. You can wrap the resulting component in a new ID or class attribute and style the inner elements to match the other content on your webpage.

## Issuing disclosure component

To meet compliance regulations and provide transparency to your cardholders, you must disclose information about the Stripe Issuing product on your website to any current or potential cardholders. The disclosure must include information about the product, the issuing bank partner, and the card network.

Because the disclosure information can change, we provide you with a UI element that you can embed directly on your website using Stripe.js (instead of giving you static text). If bank partners or card program details change in the future, this component automatically updates to reflect the latest disclosure information without requiring future code changes.
