# Stripe.js reference

## Stripe.js reference

This reference documents every object and method available in Stripe’s browser-side JavaScript library, Stripe.js.
Use our [React Stripe.js reference](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/react.md) if you want to add Elements to your React based app.

You can use Stripe.js’ APIs to tokenize customer information,
collect sensitive payment details using customizable [Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements.md),
and accept payments with [browser payment APIs](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button.md)
like Apple Pay and the Payment Request API.

## Including Stripe.js

Include the Stripe.js script on each page of your site—it should always be loaded directly from `https://js.stripe.com`, rather than included in a bundle or hosted yourself.

To best leverage Stripe’s advanced fraud functionality, include this script on every page, not just the checkout page.
This [allows Stripe to detect suspicious behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/advanced-fraud-detection.md) that may be indicative of fraud as customers browse your website.

**Using Stripe.js as a module**

We also provide an npm package that makes it easier to load and use Stripe.js as a module.
For more information, check out the [project on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js).

**Asynchronous and deferred loading of Stripe.js**

Asynchronous loading of JavaScript is generally recommended, as it can improve the user experience of your site by not blocking DOM rendering during [script loading.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript#script_loading_strategies)
The easiest way to asynchronously load Stripe.js is to use the npm module as described above.
It does asynchronous loading by default.

You can also load Stripe.js using the `async` or `defer` attribute on the script tag.
Note, however, that with asynchronous loading any API calls will have to be made only after the script execution has finished.

**Versioning**

The Stripe.js URL is versioned—we recommend keeping up to date with the latest version. For more information, see the [Stripe.js versioning and support policy](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-versioning.md).

## Initializing Stripe.js

`Stripe(publishableKey: string, options?: object)`

Use `Stripe(publishableKey, options?)` to create an instance of the **Stripe object**. The Stripe object is your entrypoint to the rest of the Stripe.js SDK.

Your Stripe publishable [API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md) is required when calling this function, as it identifies your website to Stripe.

We've prefilled the example with a sample [test API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md). Don’t submit any personally identifiable information in requests made with this key.
To create a Stripe object using your account, replace the sample API key with your actual API key or [sign in](https://docs.stripe.com/login.md?redirect=%2Fdocs%2Fjs%2Finitializing).


When you’re ready to accept live payments, replace the test key with your live key in production.
Learn more about how API keys work in [test mode and live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard.md#viewing-test-data).

When you use the same publishable API key and options, create and share a single instance of the Stripe object. Creating multiple instances might lead to performance issues.

- `publishableKey`
  Your publishable key.

- `options`
  Initialization options.
    - `stripeAccount`
      For usage with [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect.md) only.
Specifying a connected account ID (e.g., `acct_24BFMpJ1svR5A89k`) allows you to perform actions on behalf of that account.
    - `apiVersion`
      Override your account's [API version](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning.md). **This option is only available on Stripe.js v3.** For versions after `v3` such as `acacia`, the API version is [pinned to the Stripe.js version](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-versioning#compatibility-with-api-versions).
    - `locale`
      A [locale](#supported_locales) used to globally configure localization in Stripe.
Setting the locale here will localize error strings for all Stripe.js methods.
It will also configure the locale for [Elements](#element_mount).
Default is `auto` (Stripe detects the locale of the browser).
    - `developerTools`
      Stripe.js developer tooling options.
      - `assistant`
        [Stripe Elements sandbox assistant](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-testing-assistant.md) options.
        - `enabled`
          Set to `false` to disable the sandbox assistant UI.
Defaults to `true` when using [Elements with the Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/custom/quickstart.md) or when using [Elements with the Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart.md) on version Clover or above.

### Example

```title
Initializing Stripe.js
```

## The Elements object

[Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements.md) are customizable UI components used to collect sensitive information in your payment forms.

Use an `Elements` instance to create and manage a group of individual [Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element.md) instances.

## Create an Elements instance

`stripe.elements(options?: object)`

This method creates an `Elements` instance, which manages a group of elements.

For the [Payment Element created without an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred.md) and the [Express Checkout Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/express-checkout-element.md), see the [Elements object without an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_without_intent.md) reference instead.

    - `locale`
      A [locale](#supported_locales) to display placeholders and error strings in.
Default is `auto` (Stripe detects the locale of the browser).

Setting the locale does not affect the behavior of postal code validation—a valid postal code for the billing country of the card is still required.

To indicate the direction of text for *right to left* languages such as Arabic and Hebrew, mount Elements underneath an HTML element that includes the `dir="rtl"` attribute.
    - `clientSecret`
      Required to use with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md) and the [Contact Details Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link.md).

  The name of the event.
In this case, `update-end`.

- `handler`
  `handler() => void` is a **callback function** that you provide that will be called when the event is fired.

### Example

```title
Handle an Elements update-end event
```

## Fetch Server Updates

`elements.fetchUpdates()`

Used with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md).

This method fetches updates from the associated [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) or [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents.md) on an existing instance of `Elements`, and reflects these updates in the Payment Element.

### Example

```title
Fetch Server Updates
```

## Submit 

`elements.submit()`

Use `elements.submit()` when creating the [Elements object without an Intent](#stripe_elements_no_intent).

Before confirming a payment, call `elements.submit()` to validate the form fields and collect any data required for [wallets](#payment_element_create-options-wallets). You must wait for this function's promise to resolve (using `async` or `.then`) before performing any other operations.

### Example

```title
Submit Elements
```

## The Element

Use `Element` instances to collect sensitive information in your checkout flow.

## The Payment Element

The [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md) is
an embeddable component for securely collecting payment details.
The Payment Element supports dozens of payment methods with a single integration.

## Create the Payment Element

`elements.create(type: 'payment', options?: object)`

This method creates an instance of the Payment Element.

- `type`
  The type of Element being created, which is `payment` in this case.

- `options`
  Options for creating the Payment Element.
    - `layout`
      Specify the layout for the Payment Element. If you only pass a layout type (`'accordion'` or `‘tabs’`) without any additional parameters, the Payment Element renders using that layout and the default values associated with it.

An object can also be passed to specify the layout with additional configuration.
      - `type`
        Defines the layout to render the Payment Element.
      - `defaultCollapsed`
        Controls if the Payment Element renders in a collapsed state (where no payment method is selected by default). When you leave this `undefined`, Stripe renders the experience that it determines will have the best conversion.
      - `radios`
        Controls when to render each Payment Method with a radio input next to its logo. The radios visually indicate the current selection of the Payment Element. Defaults to `'auto'`.

- `'always'` — Always show radio inputs.
- `'never'` — Never show radio inputs.
- `'if_multiple'` — Show radio inputs only when there are multiple payment methods available. When there is only one payment method, no radio input is displayed.
- `'auto'` — Stripe determines the best experience to optimize conversion.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
      - `spacedAccordionItems`
        When `true`, the Payment Methods render as standalone buttons with space in between them.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
      - `visibleAccordionItemsCount`
        Sets the max number of Payment Methods visible before using the "More" button to hide additional Payment Methods. Set this value to `0` to disable the "More" button and render all available Payment Methods. Default is `5`.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
      - `paymentMethodLogoPosition`
        Sets the position of the payment method logo in each accordion item. Default is `start`.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
    - `defaultValues`
      Provide initial customer information that will be displayed in the Payment Element.
The form will render with empty fields if not provided.
      - `billingDetails`
        Specify customer's billing details, which lets you pre-fill a customer’s name, email,
phone number and address if required by payment method. Pre-filling as much information
as possible streamlines the checkout process.
        - `name`
        - `email`
        - `phone`
        - `address`
          - `line1`
          - `line2`
          - `city`
            The name of a city, town, village, etc.
          - `state`
            The most coarse subdivision of a country.
Depending on the country, this might correspond to a state, a province, an oblast, a prefecture, or something else along these lines.
          - `country`
            Two-letter country code, capitalized. Valid two-letter country codes are specified by ISO3166 alpha-2.
          - `postal_code`
            The postal code or ZIP code, also known as PIN code in India.
      - `paymentMethods`
        Specify customer's default information for different payment methods. Pre-filling as much information
as possible streamlines the checkout process.
        - `ideal`
          - `bank`
            A pre-filled iDEAL bank value for the Payment Element. Can only be one of the banks listed in the [iDEAL guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/accept-a-payment?ui=element.md#bank-reference) (e.g., `abn_amro`).
        - `payto`
          - `usePayId`
            When `true`, the PayTo payment method will default to showing the PayID input instead of BSB/account number fields. Customers can still switch between PayID and BSB/account number using the toggle link.
      - `card`
        Specify default settings for card payments.
        - `network`
          Specifies a network preference for [Card Brand Choice](https://docs.stripe.com/card-brand-choice.md). The first network in the array that matches a network on the entered co-branded card will be selected by default in the Card Brand Choice dropdown. See the [supported networks](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/create.md#create_payment_method-card-networks-preferred) for valid values.
    - `business`
      Provide information about your business that will be displayed in the Payment Element.
This information will be retrieved from your Stripe account if not provided.
      - `name`
        The name of your business. Your business name will be used to render mandate text for some payment methods.
    - `paymentMethodOrder`
      By default, the Payment Element will use a dynamic ordering that optimizes payment method display for each user.

You can override the default order in which payment methods are displayed in the Payment Element with a list of payment method types.

If the associated PaymentIntent has payment method types not specified in `paymentMethodOrder`, they will be displayed
after the payment methods you specify. If you specify payment method types not on the associated PaymentIntent, they will be ignored.
    - `fields`
      By default, the Payment Element collects all necessary details to complete a payment.

For some payment methods, the Payment Element collects details such as name or email
that you might have already collected from the customer. If this is the case, you can prevent the Payment Element
from collecting these details by using the `fields` option.

If you disable collecting certain fields
with the `fields` option, you must pass that same data to [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment.md)
or we'll reject the payment.

Learn how to [customize the billing details to collect](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/control-billing-details-collection.md) and
the [customized fields](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-customized_fields).
      - `billingDetails`
        Specify `never` to avoid collecting all [billing details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object.md#payment_method_object-billing_details)
in the Payment Element. If you would like to disable only certain billing details,
pass an object specifying which fields you would like to disable collection for.
The default setting for each field or object is `auto`.
        - `name`
        - `email`
          Specify `never` to avoid collecting email in the Payment Element.

Note that this parameter is independent of [walletOptions](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-options-walletOptions), so if you set `fields.billingDetails.email=never` and `walletOptions.emailRequired=true`, email is still collected from wallets.
        - `phone`
          Specify `never` to avoid collecting phone in the Payment Element.

Note that this parameter is independent of [walletOptions](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-options-walletOptions), so if you set `fields.billingDetails.phone=never` and `walletOptions.phoneNumberRequired=true`, phone is still collected from wallets.
        - `address`
          Specify `if_required` to only collect the minimum billing address fields required to complete the payment.
You can omit and hide optional address fields in the card form, such as country and postal code.
Unlike the `never` option, you don't need to include fields omitted in the Payment Element when confirming the payment.
This can reduce the amount of information required to complete the form.

Disabling address collection can negatively impact authorization rates and network fees for users on a network cost plus pricing plan.
          - `line1`
          - `line2`
          - `city`
            The name of a city, town, village, etc.
          - `state`
            The most coarse subdivision of a country.
Depending on the country, this might correspond to a state, a province, an oblast, a prefecture, or something else along these lines.
          - `country`
            Two-letter country code, capitalized. Valid two-letter country codes are specified by ISO3166 alpha-2.
          - `postalCode`
            The postal code or ZIP code, also known as PIN code in India.
    - `readOnly`
      Applies a read-only state to the Payment Element so that payment details can’t be changed. Default is false.

Enabling the `readOnly` option doesn't change the Payment Element's visual appearance. If you want to adjust the way the Payment Element looks, use the [Appearance API](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md).
    - `terms`
      Control how mandates or other legal agreements are displayed in the Payment Element.
Use `never` to never display legal agreements. The default setting is `auto`, which causes
legal agreements to only be shown when necessary.

Consult your legal and compliance advisors before making any changes to the text of mandates or legal agreements. You can't use the `terms` option to violate obligations under your Stripe agreement, Stripe policies, applicable laws or scheme rules.

      - `googlePay`
      - `ideal`
      - `paypal`
      - `sepaDebit`
      - `sofort`
      - `usBankAccount`
    - `wallets`
      By default, the Payment Element will display all the payment
methods that the underlying Payment Intent was created with.

However, wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay are not payment
methods per the Payment Intent API. They will show when the
Payment Intent has the `card` payment method and the customer is
using a supported platform and have an active card in their
account.  This is the `auto` behavior, and it is the default for
choice for all wallets.

If you do not want to show a given wallet as a payment option, you
can set its property in `wallets` to `never`.
      - `applePay`
      - `googlePay`

      - `phoneNumberRequired`
        Collect the customer's phone number from wallet payment methods by setting this option to true.

PayPal doesn't provide a phone number, even when this option is set to true.

Google Pay makes a best effort to return the phone number registered to the wallet, but doesn't guarantee it will be provided in all cases.

Link makes a best effort to return the phone number registered to the wallet, but doesn't guarantee it will be provided in all cases.

    - `billingDetails`
      Specify `never` to avoid collecting all [billing details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object.md#payment_method_object-billing_details)
in the Payment Element. If you would like to disable only certain billing details,
pass an object specifying which fields you would like to disable collection for.
The default setting for each field or object is `auto`.
      - `name`
      - `email`
        Specify `never` to avoid collecting email in the Payment Element.

Note that this parameter is independent of [walletOptions](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-options-walletOptions), so if you set `fields.billingDetails.email=never` and `walletOptions.emailRequired=true`, email is still collected from wallets.
      - `phone`
        Specify `never` to avoid collecting phone in the Payment Element.

Note that this parameter is independent of [walletOptions](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-options-walletOptions), so if you set `fields.billingDetails.phone=never` and `walletOptions.phoneNumberRequired=true`, phone is still collected from wallets.

- `options`
  Options for updating the Payment Element.
    - `layout`
      Specify the layout for the Payment Element. If you only pass a layout type (`'accordion'` or `‘tabs’`) without any additional parameters, the Payment Element renders using that layout and the default values associated with it.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
      - `visibleAccordionItemsCount`
        Sets the max number of Payment Methods visible before using the "More" button to hide additional Payment Methods. Set this value to `0` to disable the "More" button and render all available Payment Methods. Default is `5`.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
      - `paymentMethodLogoPosition`
        Sets the position of the payment method logo in each accordion item. Default is `start`.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._

      Provide initial customer information that will be displayed in the Payment Element.
The form will render with empty fields if not provided.
      - `billingDetails`
        Specify customer's billing details, which lets you pre-fill a customer’s name, email,
phone number and address if required by payment method. Pre-filling as much information
as possible streamlines the checkout process.
        - `name`
        - `email`
        - `phone`
        - `address`
          - `line1`
          - `line2`
          - `city`
            The name of a city, town, village, etc.
          - `state`
            The most coarse subdivision of a country.
Depending on the country, this might correspond to a state, a province, an oblast, a prefecture, or something else along these lines.
          - `country`
            Two-letter country code, capitalized. Valid two-letter country codes are specified by ISO3166 alpha-2.
          - `postal_code`
            The postal code or ZIP code, also known as PIN code in India.
      - `paymentMethods`
        Specify customer's default information for different payment methods. Pre-filling as much information
as possible streamlines the checkout process.
        - `ideal`
          - `bank`
            A pre-filled iDEAL bank value for the Payment Element. Can only be one of the banks listed in the [iDEAL guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/accept-a-payment?ui=element.md#bank-reference) (e.g., `abn_amro`).
        - `payto`
          - `usePayId`
            When `true`, the PayTo payment method will default to showing the PayID input instead of BSB/account number fields. Customers can still switch between PayID and BSB/account number using the toggle link.
      - `card`
        Specify default settings for card payments.
        - `network`
          Specifies a network preference for [Card Brand Choice](https://docs.stripe.com/card-brand-choice.md). The first network in the array that matches a network on the entered co-branded card will be selected by default in the Card Brand Choice dropdown. See the [supported networks](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/create.md#create_payment_method-card-networks-preferred) for valid values.
    - `business`
      Provide information about your business that will be displayed in the Payment Element.
This information will be retrieved from your Stripe account if not provided.
      - `name`
        The name of your business. Your business name will be used to render mandate text for some payment methods.
    - `paymentMethodOrder`
      By default, the Payment Element will use a dynamic ordering that optimizes payment method display for each user.

You can override the default order in which payment methods are displayed in the Payment Element with a list of payment method types.

If the associated PaymentIntent has payment method types not specified in `paymentMethodOrder`, they will be displayed
after the payment methods you specify. If you specify payment method types not on the associated PaymentIntent, they will be ignored.
    - `fields`
      By default, the Payment Element collects all necessary details to complete a payment.

For some payment methods, the Payment Element collects details such as name or email
that you might have already collected from the customer. If this is the case, you can prevent the Payment Element
from collecting these details by using the `fields` option.

If you disable collecting certain fields
with the `fields` option, you must pass that same data to [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment.md)
or we'll reject the payment.

Learn how to [customize the billing details to collect](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/control-billing-details-collection.md) and
the [customized fields](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-customized_fields).
      - `billingDetails`
        Specify `never` to avoid collecting all [billing details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object.md#payment_method_object-billing_details)
in the Payment Element. If you would like to disable only certain billing details,
pass an object specifying which fields you would like to disable collection for.
The default setting for each field or object is `auto`.
        - `name`
        - `email`
          Specify `never` to avoid collecting email in the Payment Element.

Note that this parameter is independent of [walletOptions](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-options-walletOptions), so if you set `fields.billingDetails.email=never` and `walletOptions.emailRequired=true`, email is still collected from wallets.
        - `phone`
          Specify `never` to avoid collecting phone in the Payment Element.

Note that this parameter is independent of [walletOptions](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-options-walletOptions), so if you set `fields.billingDetails.phone=never` and `walletOptions.phoneNumberRequired=true`, phone is still collected from wallets.
        - `address`
          Specify `if_required` to only collect the minimum billing address fields required to complete the payment.
You can omit and hide optional address fields in the card form, such as country and postal code.
Unlike the `never` option, you don't need to include fields omitted in the Payment Element when confirming the payment.
This can reduce the amount of information required to complete the form.

Disabling address collection can negatively impact authorization rates and network fees for users on a network cost plus pricing plan.
          - `line1`
          - `line2`
          - `city`
            The name of a city, town, village, etc.
          - `state`
            The most coarse subdivision of a country.
Depending on the country, this might correspond to a state, a province, an oblast, a prefecture, or something else along these lines.
          - `country`
            Two-letter country code, capitalized. Valid two-letter country codes are specified by ISO3166 alpha-2.
          - `postalCode`
            The postal code or ZIP code, also known as PIN code in India.
    - `readOnly`
      Applies a read-only state to the Payment Element so that payment details can’t be changed. Default is false.

Enabling the `readOnly` option doesn't change the Payment Element's visual appearance. If you want to adjust the way the Payment Element looks, use the [Appearance API](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md).
    - `terms`
      Control how mandates or other legal agreements are displayed in the Payment Element.
Use `never` to never display legal agreements. The default setting is `auto`, which causes
legal agreements to only be shown when necessary.

Consult your legal and compliance advisors before making any changes to the text of mandates or legal agreements. You can't use the `terms` option to violate obligations under your Stripe agreement, Stripe policies, applicable laws or scheme rules.

property in `paymentMethods` to `never`.
      - `amazonPay`
      - `applePay`
        Apple Pay has additional configurations
that determine when Stripe can show it. By default, Apple Pay shows when the customer
is using a supported platform and when we determine it's advantageous for your conversion.
This is the `auto` behavior.

If you want to always show Apple Pay when the customer is using a supported platform,
you can set its property in `paymentMethods` to `always`. This causes Apple Pay to be shown in supported browsers even when the customer
isn't logged in to Apple Pay, resulting in a sign-in flow.

Apple Pay on non-Safari desktop browsers is only supported when its property in `paymentMethods` is set to `always`.
      - `googlePay`
        Google Pay has additional configurations
that determine when Stripe can show it. By default, Google Pay shows when the customer
is using a supported platform and when we determine it's advantageous for your conversion.
This is the `auto` behavior.

If you want to always show Google Pay when the customer is using a supported platform,

We highly recommend that you collect the billing address because it can be used to perform address verifications and block fraudulent payments.
      - `business (deprecated)`
        _This parameter has been deprecated in favor of the `business` param on the [create](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_express_checkout_element.md#express_checkout_element_create-options-business) function._

## Confirm event

`expressCheckoutElement.on(event: string, handler: function)`

The `confirm` event is triggered from an Express Checkout Element when the customer
finalizes their payment. Use this event to trigger payment confirmation.

- `event`
  The name of the event.
In this case, `confirm`.

- `handler`
  A callback function `handler(event) => void` you provide that's

to provide a hint to the customer on why their payment failed.
      - `message`
        A short, concise, localized error message to display on the payment sheet.
If none is provided, the payment sheet will display a generic error message for the given reason.

**Wallet compatibility:** Apple Pay displays custom error messages for `'invalid_shipping_address'`, `'invalid_billing_address'`, and `'invalid_payment_data'`, but not for `'fail'` or `'address_unserviceable'`. Other wallets may not support custom messages or may truncate them.

## Cancel event

`expressCheckoutElement.on(event: string, handler: function)`

The `cancel` event is triggered from an Express Checkout Element when the payment interface is dismissed.

Note that in some browsers, the payment interface might be dismissed by the customer even after they authorize the payment.
This means that you might receive a `cancel` event after receiving a `confirm` event.
If you're using the `cancel` event as a hook for canceling the customer's order, make sure you also refund the payment that you just created.

- `event`

    - `elementType`
      The type of element the event is fired from.
    - `paymentMethods`

      - `applePay`
        - `available`
      - `googlePay`

    - `address`
      The shipping address of the recipient.

To maintain privacy, browsers might anonymize the shipping address by removing sensitive information that isn't necessary to calculate shipping costs.
Depending on the country, some fields can be missing or partially redacted.
For example, the shipping address in the US can only contain a city, state, and ZIP code.
The full shipping address appears in the [confirm event](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/express_checkout_element_confirm_event.md#express_checkout_element_on_confirm-handler-shippingAddress) object after the purchase is confirmed in the browser’s payment interface.

## Issuing Elements

[Issuing Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/elements.md) allows you to display
the sensitive data of your Issuing cards in a PCI-compliant manner.

## Create an Element

`elements.create(type: string, options: object)`

This method creates an instance of an individual Issuing Element.

It takes the `type` of Element to create as well as an `options` object.

## Other Elements

Stripe also offers a [set of Elements for individual payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements.md) that you can use in your payment flows.

## Create an Element

`elements.create(type: string, options?: object)`

This method creates an instance of an individual `Element`.

It takes the `type` of `Element` to create as well as an `options` object.

## Get an Element

`elements.getElement(type: string)`

This method looks up a previously created [Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element.md) by its type.

- `type`
  The type of [Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_element.md) to lookup.

### Example

```title
Get an Element
```

## Update an Element

`element.update(options: object)`

Updates the options the [Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element.md)
was initialized with. Updates are merged into the existing configuration.

If you collect certain information in a different part of your interface
(e.g., ZIP or postal code), use `element.update` with the appropriate information.

The styles of an `Element` can be dynamically changed using `element.update`.
This method can be used to simulate CSS media queries that automatically adjust
the size of elements when viewed on different devices.

## Style the Element container

Style the container you mount an [Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element.md) to as if it were an `<input>` on your page.
For example, to control `padding` and `border` on an `Element`, set these properties on the container.
This is usually done by re-using the classes that you have applied to your DOM `<input>` elements.
After the `Element` is mounted, the `.StripeElement` class is added to the container.
Additionally, the following classes are automatically added to the container when the `Element` is complete, empty, focused, invalid, or autofilled by the browser:

* `.StripeElement--complete`
* `.StripeElement--empty`
* `.StripeElement--focus`
* `.StripeElement--invalid`
* `.StripeElement--webkit-autofill` (Chrome and Safari only)

These class names can be customized using the `classes` [option](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_element.md#elements_create-options-classes) when you [create an Element](#elements_create).

## Input validation

Stripe elements validate customer input as it is typed.
To help your customers catch mistakes, listen to `change` events on an `Element` and display any errors.

## Postal code formatting

The `card` element automatically determines your customer’s billing address country based on their card number.
Using this information, the postal code field validation reflects whether that country uses numeric or alphanumeric-formatted postal codes, or if the country uses postal codes at all.
For instance, if a U.S. card is entered, the postal code field only accepts a five-digit numeric value.
If it’s a UK card, an alphanumeric value can be provided instead.

Many of our test cards have a U.S. billing address country.
When using these to test your payment form, you must also use a five-digit U.S. ZIP code (e.g., 12345).
To test elements with other postal code formats, use our [international test card numbers](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#international-cards).

## Mount an Element

`element.mount(domElement: string | DOM element)`

The `element.mount` method attaches your [Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element.md) to the DOM.
`element.mount` accepts either a CSS Selector (e.g., `'#payment-element'`) or a DOM element.

You need to create a container DOM element to mount an `Element`.
Add an empty placeholder `div` to your payment form for each Element that you'll mount.
Stripe inserts an iframe into each `div` to securely collect payment information.

- `domElement`
  The CSS selector or DOM element where your [Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element.md) will be mounted.

### Example

```title
Mount an Element
```

## Element methods

If your integration uses the [Express Checkout Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/express-checkout-element.md), the email address is collected directly from the wallet and the value set by `updateEmail` is not used for express checkout payments.

- `email`
  The Customer's email address.

### Example

```title
Update the Customer's email address
```

## Update the Customer's phone number

`actions.updatePhoneNumber(phoneNumber: nullable string)`

Use this method to update the Customer's phone number.

If the [Tax ID Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/create_tax_id_element.md) is mounted with the business name field shown, calling `confirm()` throws an `IntegrationError` because the Tax ID Element collects the business name directly. To use `updateBusinessName()` instead, set `fields.businessName: "never"` when creating the Tax ID Element.

  The Customer's business name.

### Example

```title

[Session's `canConfirm` field](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md#custom_checkout_session_object-canConfirm).

### Example

```title
Validate Elements
```

## Confirm the Checkout Session

`actions.confirm(options?: object)`

Use this method to confirm the Checkout Session.

You must either read [total.total.amount](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md#custom_checkout_session_object-total-total-amount) or each of [total.total.minorUnitsAmount](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md#custom_checkout_session_object-total-total-minorUnitsAmount) and [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md#custom_checkout_session_object-currency) and [minorUnitsAmountDivisor](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md#custom_checkout_session_object-minorUnitsAmountDivisor) from the checkout object and display in your UI, otherwise an error will be thrown. This helps keep your checkout page in sync as the Checkout Session updates, including adding future Stripe features, with minimal UI code changes.

## Checkout events

Listen to Checkout events to respond to changes caused by customer actions on your checkout page.

## Change event

`checkout.on(event: 'change', handler: function)`

The change event is triggered when [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md)
data changes, such as when the customer changes their shipping
address.  The event payload is always a [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md)
object.

- `event`
  The name of the event. In this case, `change`.

- `handler`
  `handler(session) => void` is a **callback function** that
you provide that will be called when the event is fired. When called
it will be passed a [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md) object.

### Example

```title

```

## Use Elements with the Checkout Sessions API

[Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements.md) are customizable UI
components you can use to build your checkout page.

Use the [Checkout Elements SDK](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/init.md)
instance to create and manage Elements.

## Create a Payment Element

`checkout.createPaymentElement(options?: object)`

This method creates an instance of a Payment Element.

- `options`
  Payment Element initialization options.
    - `fields`
      By default, the Payment Element collects only the necessary billing details to complete a payment.

To collect billing details outside of the Payment Element, use the `fields` option to disable Payment Element collection of certain fields.
      - `billingDetails`
        Specify `never` to avoid collecting all [billing details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object.md#payment_method_object-billing_details)
in the Payment Element. If you would like to disable only certain billing details,
pass an object specifying which fields you would like to disable collection for.
The default setting for each field or object is `auto`.
        - `name`
        - `email`
          Specify `never` to avoid collecting email in the Payment Element.

Note that this parameter is independent of [walletOptions](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-options-walletOptions), so if you set `fields.billingDetails.email=never` and `walletOptions.emailRequired=true`, email is still collected from wallets.
        - `phone`
          Specify `never` to avoid collecting phone in the Payment Element.

Note that this parameter is independent of [walletOptions](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-options-walletOptions), so if you set `fields.billingDetails.phone=never` and `walletOptions.phoneNumberRequired=true`, phone is still collected from wallets.
        - `address`
          Specify `if_required` to only collect the minimum billing address fields required to complete the payment.
You can omit and hide optional address fields in the card form, such as country and postal code.
Unlike the `never` option, you don't need to include fields omitted in the Payment Element when confirming the payment.
This can reduce the amount of information required to complete the form.

Disabling address collection can negatively impact authorization rates and network fees for users on a network cost plus pricing plan.
          - `line1`
          - `line2`
          - `city`
            The name of a city, town, village, etc.
          - `state`
            The most coarse subdivision of a country.
Depending on the country, this might correspond to a state, a province, an oblast, a prefecture, or something else along these lines.
          - `country`
            Two-letter country code, capitalized. Valid two-letter country codes are specified by ISO3166 alpha-2.
          - `postalCode`
            The postal code or ZIP code, also known as PIN code in India.
    - `layout`
      Specify the layout for the Payment Element. If you only pass a layout type (`'accordion'` or `‘tabs’`) without any additional parameters, the Payment Element renders using that layout and the default values associated with it.

An object can also be passed to specify the layout with additional configuration.
      - `type`
        Defines the layout to render the Payment Element.
      - `defaultCollapsed`
        Controls if the Payment Element renders in a collapsed state (where no payment method is selected by default). When you leave this `undefined`, Stripe renders the experience that it determines will have the best conversion.
      - `radios`
        Controls when to render each Payment Method with a radio input next to its logo. The radios visually indicate the current selection of the Payment Element. Defaults to `'auto'`.

- `'always'` — Always show radio inputs.
- `'never'` — Never show radio inputs.
- `'if_multiple'` — Show radio inputs only when there are multiple payment methods available. When there is only one payment method, no radio input is displayed.
- `'auto'` — Stripe determines the best experience to optimize conversion.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
      - `spacedAccordionItems`
        When `true`, the Payment Methods render as standalone buttons with space in between them.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
      - `visibleAccordionItemsCount`
        Sets the max number of Payment Methods visible before using the "More" button to hide additional Payment Methods. Set this value to `0` to disable the "More" button and render all available Payment Methods. Default is `5`.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
      - `paymentMethodLogoPosition`
        Sets the position of the payment method logo in each accordion item. Default is `start`.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
    - `paymentMethodOrder`
      By default, the Payment Element will use a dynamic ordering that optimizes payment method display for each user.

You can override the default order in which payment methods are displayed in the Payment Element with a list of payment method types.

If the associated Checkout Session has payment method types not specified in `paymentMethodOrder`, they will be displayed
after the payment methods you specify. If you specify payment method types not on the associated PaymentIntent, they will be ignored.
    - `readOnly`
      Applies a read-only state to the Payment Element so that payment details can’t be changed. Default is false.

Enabling the `readOnly` option doesn't change the Payment Element's visual appearance. If you want to adjust the way the Payment Element looks, use the [Appearance API](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md).
    - `terms`
      Control how mandates or other legal agreements are displayed in the Payment Element.
Use `never` to never display legal agreements. The default setting is `auto`, which causes
legal agreements to only be shown when necessary.

Consult your legal and compliance advisors before making any changes to the text of mandates or legal agreements. You can't use the `terms` option to violate obligations under your Stripe agreement, Stripe policies, applicable laws or scheme rules.

      - `sepaDebit`
      - `sofort`
      - `usBankAccount`
    - `wallets`
      By default, the Payment Element will display all the payment
methods that the underlying Checkout Session was created with.

However, wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay are not payment
methods per the Checkout Session API. They will show when the
Checkout Session has the `card` payment method and the customer is
using a supported platform and have an active card in their
account.  This is the `auto` behavior, and it is the default for
choice for all wallets.

If you do not want to show a given wallet as a payment option, you
can set its property in `wallets` to `never`.
      - `applePay`
      - `googlePay`

        Collect the customer's email from wallet payment methods by setting this option to true.
      - `phoneNumberRequired`
        Collect the customer's phone number from wallet payment methods by setting this option to true.

PayPal doesn't provide a phone number, even when this option is set to true.

Google Pay makes a best effort to return the phone number registered to the wallet, but doesn't guarantee it will be provided in all cases.

Link makes a best effort to return the phone number registered to the wallet, but doesn't guarantee it will be provided in all cases.

## Listen to Elements events

Communicate with your [Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/custom_checkout_elements.md) by listening to an event.
An Element might emit any of the events below.
All events have a payload object that has an `elementType` property with the type of the `Element` that emitted the event.

Use the `.on` method on the Element instance to listen to events.

See also: [Elements methods](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/custom_checkout_elements.md) | [Listen to Checkout events](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/events.md)

## Change event

`element.on(event: 'change', handler: function)`

The change event is triggered when any value in the change event payload changes.
The event payload always contains certain keys, in addition to some `Element`-specific keys.

The following Checkout Elements support the `change` event:
`paymentElement`, `billingAddressElement`, `shippingAddressElement`, `taxIdElement`, and `checkoutForm`.

Use this event to trigger payment confirmation.

The following Checkout Elements support the `confirm` event:
`expressCheckoutElement` and `checkoutForm`.

## Cancel event

`element.on(event: string, handler: function)`

The `cancel` event is triggered when the payment interface is dismissed (e.g. the customer closes it).

Note that in some browsers, the payment interface might be dismissed by the customer even after they authorize the payment.
This means that you might receive a `cancel` event after receiving a `confirm` event.
If you're using the `cancel` event as a hook for canceling the customer's order, make sure you also refund the payment that you just created.

The following Checkout Elements support the `cancel` event:
`expressCheckoutElement` and `checkoutForm`.

## React Stripe.js reference

The React bindings for Stripe.js provide context providers, hooks, and Element components for both
[Checkout Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md) and direct [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) or
[SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents.md) integrations.

The sections below document the APIs exported from `@stripe/react-stripe-js`
and `@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout`,
grouped by the provider you render (`CheckoutElementsProvider` or `Elements`).

## Using the Checkout provider

Build your Stripe integration using React, Stripe Elements, and the [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md).

See [build a checkout page](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/quickstart-checkout-sessions.md) for steps on using Elements with the Checkout Sessions API.

The following React components and hooks are available to use as part of your integration.

## CheckoutElementsProvider

The `CheckoutElementsProvider` component allows you to use Element components and access data from your [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md) in any nested component.
Wrap the portion of your React tree that renders individual Element components to make the Checkout instance available via React context.

To use `CheckoutElementsProvider`, call `loadStripe` from `@stripe/stripe-js` with your publishable key. The `loadStripe` function asynchronously loads the Stripe.js script and initializes a Stripe object. Pass the returned `Promise` to `CheckoutElementsProvider` along with the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-client_secret) of your Checkout Session.

### Props

- `stripe`
  A [Stripe object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/initializing.md) or a `Promise` resolving to a Stripe object. The easiest way to initialize a Stripe object is with the [Stripe.js wrapper module](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js/blob/master/README.md#readme). After this prop has been set, it can not be changed.

- `options`
  Options for `CheckoutElementsProvider`.
    - `clientSecret`
      The Checkout Session [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-client_secret) or a promise that resolves to the client secret.
    - `elementsOptions`
      A set of options to configure Elements created with [Checkout Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md).
      - `appearance`
        Match the design of your site with the [appearance option](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md).
The layout of each Element stays consistent, but you can modify colors, fonts, borders, padding, and more.
      - `loader`
        Display skeleton loader UI while waiting for Elements to fully load after they're mounted.
Default is `'auto'` (Stripe determines whether or not to show a loader UI).
      - `fonts`
        An array of custom fonts that elements created from the `Elements` object can use. You can specify fonts as [CssFontSource](#css_font_source_object) or [CustomFontSource](#custom_font_source_object) objects.
      - `savedPaymentMethod`
        Options to configure what Elements displays when used to [Save payment details during payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/save-during-payment.md).
        - `enableRedisplay`
          Toggle if Elements redisplays Customer saved Payment Methods. Default is `'auto'`. Prior to Clover, this defaulted to `'never'`.
        - `enableSave`
          Toggle if the Payment Element collects consent to save a Customer's Payment Methods. Default is `'auto'`. Prior to Clover, this defaulted to `'never'`.
      - `syncAddressCheckbox`
        Used with the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element.md).

The `syncAddressCheckbox` parameter configures which Address Element to show the checkbox.

The checkbox allows the customer the option to sync billing and shipping addresses when both Billing and Shipping Address Elements are used in a single Elements instance.

The default value is `'billing'`.
    - `adaptivePricing`
      Options for [Adaptive Pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/currencies/localize-prices/adaptive-pricing.md?payment-ui=embedded-components).
      - `allowed`
        Whether Adaptive Pricing can be used with this integration. Default is `false`.
[Additional setup](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/currencies/localize-prices/adaptive-pricing.md?payment-ui=embedded-components) is required before you can use Adaptive Pricing with Checkout elements.

### Example

```title
Mount CheckoutElementsProvider
```

## useCheckoutElements

The `useCheckoutElements` hook returns a disjoint union describing the loading state:

* `{type: "loading"}`
* `{type: "error", error: { message: string }}`
* `{type: "success", checkout: object }`.

Upon success, it returns a [Session object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md) as well as actions to update the Checkout Session.

Use `useCheckoutElements` inside a [CheckoutElementsProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/checkout_provider.md). For [CheckoutFormProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout_form/checkout_form_provider.md) integrations, use [useCheckoutForm](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout_form/use_checkout_form.md) instead.

### Example

```title
Call useCheckoutElements hook
```

## useCheckout

> This feature is in private preview. See [Embedded form](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works.md?payment-ui=checkout-form) for more information.

*`useCheckout` is deprecated. Use [useCheckoutElements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/use_checkout_elements.md) inside a [CheckoutElementsProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/checkout_provider.md), or [useCheckoutForm](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout_form/use_checkout_form.md) inside a [CheckoutFormProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout_form/checkout_form_provider.md). The new hooks provide compile-time type safety for the actions available under each provider.*

The `useCheckout` hook returns a disjoint union describing the loading state:

* `{type: "loading"}`
* `{type: "error", error: { message: string }}`
* `{type: "success", checkout: object }`.

Upon success, it returns a [Session object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md) as well as actions to update the Checkout Session.

You must either read [total.total.amount](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md#custom_checkout_session_object-total-total-amount) or each of [total.total.minorUnitsAmount](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md#custom_checkout_session_object-total-total-minorUnitsAmount) and [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md#custom_checkout_session_object-currency) and [minorUnitsAmountDivisor](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md#custom_checkout_session_object-minorUnitsAmountDivisor) from the checkout object and display in your UI, otherwise an error will be thrown. This helps keep your checkout page in sync as the Checkout Session updates, including adding future Stripe features, with minimal UI code changes.

- `options`
  Options for `confirm`.
    - `returnUrl`
      The URL to redirect your customer to after they authenticate or cancel their payment on the payment method’s app or site. This parameter is only required if you didn't specify the  `return_url` when creating the Checkout Session.
    - `paymentMethod`
      The ID of a previously collected [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object.md) to use for confirmation.

When this option is provided, Custom Checkout will ignore the payment method collected by the PaymentElement and attempt confirmation using the provided PaymentMethod.
    - `savePaymentMethod`

Learn how to [save payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/custom-checkout/save-payment-methods-checkout.md).
    - `redirect`
      By default, `confirm` will always redirect to your `returnUrl` after a successful confirmation.  If you set `redirect: "if_required"`, then `confirm` will only redirect if your user chooses a redirect-based payment method.

### Example

```title
Confirm the Checkout Session
```

## Validate Elements

`validateElements()`

Use this method to validate all mounted Elements without confirming the Checkout Session. This is useful for multi-step checkout flows where you want to validate user input before advancing to the next step.

This method doesn't verify that the Checkout Session can be confirmed.
To check whether all required fields are present, use the
[Session's `canConfirm` field](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md#custom_checkout_session_object-canConfirm).

### Example

```title
Validate Elements
```

## Run server update

`runServerUpdate(userFunction: function)`

Use this method to wrap an async function that makes a request to your server to update the Checkout Session.

> `runServerUpdate` enforces a 20-second timeout for your update function. If your function doesn't resolve within 20 seconds, `runServerUpdate` returns an error. Wrap `runServerUpdate` calls in `try`/`catch` blocks to handle any errors.

- `userFunction`
  An async function to make a request to your server to update the Checkout Session.

### Example

```title
Run server update
```

## PaymentElement

Use the `PaymentElement` from `@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout`
to collect payment details for more than [40 payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods/integration-options.md) from around the globe.

The component must be rendered inside a [CheckoutElementsProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/checkout_provider.md).

### Props

- `id`
  Sets the DOM `id` attribute on the rendered Element container. Use this to
target the Element for styling or testing.

- `className`
  Applies custom CSS classes to the Element container.

- `options`
  Payment Element initialization options.
    - `fields`
      By default, the Payment Element collects only the necessary billing details to complete a payment.

To collect billing details outside of the Payment Element, use the `fields` option to disable Payment Element collection of certain fields.
      - `billingDetails`
        Specify `never` to avoid collecting all [billing details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object.md#payment_method_object-billing_details)
in the Payment Element. If you would like to disable only certain billing details,
pass an object specifying which fields you would like to disable collection for.
The default setting for each field or object is `auto`.
        - `name`
        - `email`
          Specify `never` to avoid collecting email in the Payment Element.

Note that this parameter is independent of [walletOptions](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-options-walletOptions), so if you set `fields.billingDetails.email=never` and `walletOptions.emailRequired=true`, email is still collected from wallets.
        - `phone`
          Specify `never` to avoid collecting phone in the Payment Element.

Note that this parameter is independent of [walletOptions](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-options-walletOptions), so if you set `fields.billingDetails.phone=never` and `walletOptions.phoneNumberRequired=true`, phone is still collected from wallets.
        - `address`
          Specify `if_required` to only collect the minimum billing address fields required to complete the payment.
You can omit and hide optional address fields in the card form, such as country and postal code.
Unlike the `never` option, you don't need to include fields omitted in the Payment Element when confirming the payment.
This can reduce the amount of information required to complete the form.

Disabling address collection can negatively impact authorization rates and network fees for users on a network cost plus pricing plan.
          - `line1`
          - `line2`
          - `city`
            The name of a city, town, village, etc.
          - `state`
            The most coarse subdivision of a country.
Depending on the country, this might correspond to a state, a province, an oblast, a prefecture, or something else along these lines.
          - `country`
            Two-letter country code, capitalized. Valid two-letter country codes are specified by ISO3166 alpha-2.
          - `postalCode`
            The postal code or ZIP code, also known as PIN code in India.
    - `layout`
      Specify the layout for the Payment Element. If you only pass a layout type (`'accordion'` or `‘tabs’`) without any additional parameters, the Payment Element renders using that layout and the default values associated with it.

An object can also be passed to specify the layout with additional configuration.
      - `type`
        Defines the layout to render the Payment Element.
      - `defaultCollapsed`
        Controls if the Payment Element renders in a collapsed state (where no payment method is selected by default). When you leave this `undefined`, Stripe renders the experience that it determines will have the best conversion.
      - `radios`
        Controls when to render each Payment Method with a radio input next to its logo. The radios visually indicate the current selection of the Payment Element. Defaults to `'auto'`.

- `'always'` — Always show radio inputs.
- `'never'` — Never show radio inputs.
- `'if_multiple'` — Show radio inputs only when there are multiple payment methods available. When there is only one payment method, no radio input is displayed.
- `'auto'` — Stripe determines the best experience to optimize conversion.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
      - `spacedAccordionItems`
        When `true`, the Payment Methods render as standalone buttons with space in between them.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
      - `visibleAccordionItemsCount`
        Sets the max number of Payment Methods visible before using the "More" button to hide additional Payment Methods. Set this value to `0` to disable the "More" button and render all available Payment Methods. Default is `5`.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
      - `paymentMethodLogoPosition`
        Sets the position of the payment method logo in each accordion item. Default is `start`.

_This property is only applicable to the `accordion` layout._
    - `paymentMethodOrder`
      By default, the Payment Element will use a dynamic ordering that optimizes payment method display for each user.

You can override the default order in which payment methods are displayed in the Payment Element with a list of payment method types.

If the associated Checkout Session has payment method types not specified in `paymentMethodOrder`, they will be displayed
after the payment methods you specify. If you specify payment method types not on the associated PaymentIntent, they will be ignored.
    - `readOnly`
      Applies a read-only state to the Payment Element so that payment details can’t be changed. Default is false.

Enabling the `readOnly` option doesn't change the Payment Element's visual appearance. If you want to adjust the way the Payment Element looks, use the [Appearance API](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md).
    - `terms`
      Control how mandates or other legal agreements are displayed in the Payment Element.
Use `never` to never display legal agreements. The default setting is `auto`, which causes
legal agreements to only be shown when necessary.

Consult your legal and compliance advisors before making any changes to the text of mandates or legal agreements. You can't use the `terms` option to violate obligations under your Stripe agreement, Stripe policies, applicable laws or scheme rules.
      - `applePay`
      - `auBecsDebit`
      - `bancontact`
      - `card`
      - `cashapp`
      - `googlePay`
      - `ideal`
      - `paypal`
      - `sepaDebit`
      - `sofort`
      - `usBankAccount`
    - `wallets`
      By default, the Payment Element will display all the payment
methods that the underlying Checkout Session was created with.

However, wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay are not payment
methods per the Checkout Session API. They will show when the
Checkout Session has the `card` payment method and the customer is
using a supported platform and have an active card in their
account.  This is the `auto` behavior, and it is the default for
choice for all wallets.

If you do not want to show a given wallet as a payment option, you
can set its property in `wallets` to `never`.
      - `applePay`
      - `googlePay`
      - `link`
    - `walletOptions`
      Options to control the information collected from the customer when
paying with a wallet payment method.
      - `emailRequired`
        Collect the customer's email from wallet payment methods by setting this option to true.
      - `phoneNumberRequired`
        Collect the customer's phone number from wallet payment methods by setting this option to true.

PayPal doesn't provide a phone number, even when this option is set to true.

Google Pay makes a best effort to return the phone number registered to the wallet, but doesn't guarantee it will be provided in all cases.

Link makes a best effort to return the phone number registered to the wallet, but doesn't guarantee it will be provided in all cases.

You can override this to specify a custom button height in the range of 40px-55px.
    - `buttonTheme`
      Specify the preferred button theme to use. By default, Elements determines the themes based on the specified [appearance option](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create.md#stripe_elements-options-appearance).
      - `applePay`
      - `googlePay`
      - `paypal`
      - `klarna`
    - `buttonType`
      Specify the preferred button type to display.
      - `applePay`
        Default is `plain`.
      - `googlePay`
        Default is `buy`.
      - `paypal`
        Default is `paypal`.
      - `klarna`
        Default is `pay`.
    - `layout`
      Specify how the buttons are arranged in a grid-like layout in the Express Checkout Element.
Elements determines the layout by using certain factors, such as available space, number of buttons, and the defined `layout` object.
      - `maxColumns`
        Defines the maximum number of columns the Express Checkout Element can use to render. Default is `0`, meaning unlimited.
      - `maxRows`
        Defines the maximum number of rows the Express Checkout Element can use to render. Default is `0`, meaning unlimited.
      - `overflow`
        Specify whether or not to always hide the overflow menu or allow Elements to determine when to show the overflow menu. Default is `auto`.
You can't specify both `overflow: 'never'` and set `maxRows` to a number greater than 0.
    - `paymentMethodOrder`
      By default, the Express Checkout Element uses a dynamic ordering that optimizes payment method display for each user.

You can override the default order in which payment methods display in the Express Checkout Element with a list of payment method types.

If there are payment methods that will show that are not specified in `paymentMethodOrder`, they display after the payment methods you specify. If you specify payment methods that will not show, they are ignored.
    - `paymentMethods`
      In addition to your Dashboard configuration, the CheckoutSession configuration also influences the availability of payment methods in the Express Checkout Element. By default, it displays all available payment methods based on both configurations. When setting the paymentMethods option, the Express Checkout Element merges your specified options with the default logic to determine the final set of payment methods displayed.
      - `amazonPay`
      - `applePay`
        Apple Pay has additional configurations
that determine when Stripe can show it. By default, Apple Pay shows when the customer
is using a supported platform and when we determine it's advantageous for your conversion.
This is the `auto` behavior.

If you want to always show Apple Pay when the customer is using a supported platform,
you can set its property in `paymentMethods` to `always`.

Apple Pay on non-Safari desktop browsers is only supported when its property in `paymentMethods` is set to `always`.
      - `googlePay`
        Google Pay has additional configurations
that determine when Stripe can show it. By default, Google Pay shows when the customer
is using a supported platform and when we determine it's advantageous for your conversion.
This is the `auto` behavior.
If you want to always show Google Pay when the customer is using a supported platform,
you can set its property in `paymentMethods` to `always`.
      - `link`
      - `paypal`

- `onConfirm`
  Triggered when the Element fires a confirm event. Use this to handle payment confirmation.

- `onCancel`
  The `cancel` event is triggered when the payment interface is dismissed (e.g. the customer closes it).

Note that in some browsers, the payment interface might be dismissed by the customer even after they authorize the payment.
This means that you might receive a `cancel` event after receiving a `confirm` event.
If you're using the `cancel` event as a hook for canceling the customer's order, make sure you also refund the payment that you just created.

The following Checkout Elements support the `cancel` event:
`expressCheckoutElement` and `checkoutForm`.

      - `taxId`
        - `required`
          Specify `always` to make tax ID a required field.
Specify `never` to make tax ID an optional field.

## Using the Embedded form provider

> This feature is in private preview. See [Embedded form](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works.md?payment-ui=checkout-form) for more information.

Build your Stripe integration using React and the [embedded form](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works.md?payment-ui=checkout-form), a single unified form that bundles payment, address, and other elements.

See [build an integration with an embedded form](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/form/quickstart.md) for steps on using the embedded form with the Checkout Sessions API.

The following React components and hooks are available to use as part of your integration.

## CheckoutFormProvider

> This feature is in private preview. See [Embedded form](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works.md?payment-ui=checkout-form) for more information.

The `CheckoutFormProvider` component wraps your React tree for the [embedded form integration](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/embeddable-payment-form.md).
It initializes the Embedded form SDK and provides it in a context so nested components can render the `CheckoutForm` component and access session data.

To use `CheckoutFormProvider`, call `loadStripe` from `@stripe/stripe-js` with your publishable key. The `loadStripe` function asynchronously loads the Stripe.js script and initializes a Stripe object. Pass the returned `Promise` to `CheckoutFormProvider` along with the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-client_secret) of your Checkout Session.

### Props

- `stripe`
  A [Stripe object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/initializing.md) or a `Promise` resolving to a Stripe object. The easiest way to initialize a Stripe object is with the [Stripe.js wrapper module](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js/blob/master/README.md#readme). After this prop has been set, it can not be changed.

- `options`
  Options for `CheckoutFormProvider`.
    - `clientSecret`
      The Checkout Session [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-client_secret) or a promise that resolves to the client secret.
    - `appearance`
      Match the design of your site with the [appearance option](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md).
The layout stays consistent, but you can modify colors, fonts, borders, padding, and more.
Note: the embedded form doesn't support `rules`.
    - `loader`
      Display skeleton loader UI while waiting for the embedded form to fully load after it's mounted.
Default is `'auto'` (Stripe determines whether or not to show a loader UI).
    - `fonts`
      An array of custom fonts that the embedded form can use. You can specify fonts as [CssFontSource](#css_font_source_object) or [CustomFontSource](#custom_font_source_object) objects.
    - `savedPaymentMethod`
      Options to configure what the embedded form displays when used to [save payment details during payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/save-during-payment.md).
      - `enableRedisplay`
        Toggle if the embedded form redisplays Customer saved Payment Methods. Default is `'auto'`.
      - `enableSave`
        Toggle if the embedded form collects consent to save a customer's payment methods. Default is `'auto'`.

### Example

```title
Mount CheckoutFormProvider
```

## useCheckoutForm

> This feature is in private preview. See [Embedded form](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works.md?payment-ui=checkout-form) for more information.

The `useCheckoutForm` hook returns a disjoint union describing the loading state:

* `{type: "loading"}`
* `{type: "error", error: { message: string }}`
* `{type: "success", checkout: object }`.

Upon success, it returns a [Session object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md) as well as actions to update the Checkout Session.

Use `useCheckoutForm` inside a [CheckoutFormProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout_form/checkout_form_provider.md). For [CheckoutElementsProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/checkout_provider.md) integrations, use [useCheckoutElements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/use_checkout_elements.md) instead.

### Example

```title
Call useCheckoutForm hook
```

## useCheckout

> This feature is in private preview. See [Embedded form](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works.md?payment-ui=checkout-form) for more information.

*`useCheckout` is deprecated. Use [useCheckoutElements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/use_checkout_elements.md) inside a [CheckoutElementsProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/checkout_provider.md), or [useCheckoutForm](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout_form/use_checkout_form.md) inside a [CheckoutFormProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout_form/checkout_form_provider.md). The new hooks provide compile-time type safety for the actions available under each provider.*

The `useCheckout` hook returns a disjoint union describing the loading state:

* `{type: "loading"}`
* `{type: "error", error: { message: string }}`
* `{type: "success", checkout: object }`.

Upon success, it returns a [Session object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session_object.md) as well as actions to update the Checkout Session.

Call useCheckout hook
```

## CheckoutForm

> This feature is in private preview. See [Embedded form](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works.md?payment-ui=checkout-form) for more information.

Use the `CheckoutForm` from `@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout` to render the embedded form; a single form that handles payment, address, and other elements.

The component must be rendered inside a [CheckoutFormProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/checkout_form_provider.md).

### Props

  Sets the DOM `id` attribute on the rendered Element container. Use this to
target the Element for styling or testing.

- `className`
  Applies custom CSS classes to the Element container.

- `options`
  Embedded form initialization options.
    - `layout`
      The layout of the embedded form. The `'expanded'` layout is a single-step embedded form, while the `'compact'` layout is a multi-step embedded form. When you leave this undefined, Stripe renders the layout it determines has the best conversion.
    - `contacts`
      An array of objects that you can use to display saved addresses in the embedded form. The first contact is automatically selected.
      - `name`
        The name of the contact. This might be a person, or a business name.

      - `promotionCodeCollection`
        Controls whether to show promotion code input in the embedded form. Defaults to `'auto'`.

- `'auto'`: Shows the promotion code input if the Checkout Session enables [allow_promotion_codes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-allow_promotion_codes).
- `'never'`: Never shows the promotion code input in the embedded form. Use this if you build your own promotion code input outside of the form.

        - `paypal`
        - `klarna`
      - `paymentMethods`
        In addition to your Dashboard configuration, the CheckoutSession configuration also influences the availability of payment methods in the Embedded form. By default, it displays all available payment methods based on both configurations. When setting the paymentMethods option, the Embedded form merges your specified options with the default logic to determine the final set of payment methods displayed.
        - `amazonPay`
        - `applePay`
          Apple Pay has additional configurations
that determine when Stripe can show it. By default, Apple Pay shows when the customer
is using a supported platform and when we determine it's advantageous for your conversion.
This is the `auto` behavior.

If you want to always show Apple Pay when the customer is using a supported platform,
you can set its property in `paymentMethods` to `always`.

Apple Pay on non-Safari desktop browsers is only supported when its property in `paymentMethods` is set to `always`.
        - `googlePay`
          Google Pay has additional configurations
that determine when Stripe can show it. By default, Google Pay shows when the customer

## Using the Elements provider

Build your Stripe integration using React and Stripe Elements.

See [build a checkout page](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/quickstart.md) for steps on using Elements with the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md).

The following React components and hooks are available to use as part of your integration.

## Elements

`Elements` mounts the Stripe Elements context for `@stripe/react-stripe-js`. Wrap the portion
of your React tree that renders individual Element components to make the Stripe object, Elements
instance, and related helpers available via React context.

For the [Payment Element created without an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred.md),
see the [ElementsProvider without an intent](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/elements/elements_provider_without_intent.md) reference instead.

### Props

- `stripe`
  A [Stripe object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/initializing.md) or a `Promise` that resolves to one. The value returned from
`loadStripe` is the recommended way to initialize this prop.

- `options`
  A set of options to create this `Elements` instance with.
    - `fonts`
      An array of custom fonts, which elements created from the `Elements` object can use. Fonts can be specified as [CssFontSource](#css_font_source_object) or [CustomFontSource](#custom_font_source_object) objects.
    - `locale`
      A [locale](#supported_locales) to display placeholders and error strings in.
Default is `auto` (Stripe detects the locale of the browser).

Setting the locale does not affect the behavior of postal code validation—a valid postal code for the billing country of the card is still required.

To indicate the direction of text for *right to left* languages such as Arabic and Hebrew, mount Elements underneath an HTML element that includes the `dir="rtl"` attribute.
    - `clientSecret`
      Required to use with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md) and the [Contact Details Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link.md).

The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) for a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent.
    - `appearance`
      Supported for the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md), the [Contact Details Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link.md), and the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element/.md).

Match the design of your site with the [appearance option](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md).
The layout of each Element stays consistent, but you can modify colors, fonts, borders, padding, and more.
    - `loader`
      Supported for the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md), the [Contact Details Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link.md), and the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element/.md).

Display skeleton loader UI while waiting for Elements to be fully loaded, after they are mounted.
Default is `'auto'` (Stripe determines if a loader UI should be shown).
    - `currency`
      Used with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md).

Influences available payment methods when creating SetupIntents with [automatic_payment_methods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create.md#create_setup_intent-automatic_payment_methods).

Mount Elements
```

## Elements without an intent

`Elements` mounts the Stripe Elements context for `@stripe/react-stripe-js`. Wrap the portion
of your React tree that renders individual Element components to make the Stripe object, Elements
instance, and related helpers available via React context.

This reference applies to the [Payment Element created without an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred.md), and [Card Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/card-element.md).
For other elements, see the [ElementsProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/elements/elements_provider.md) reference instead.

### Props

- `stripe`
  A [Stripe object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/initializing.md) or a `Promise` that resolves to one. The value returned from
`loadStripe` is the recommended way to initialize this prop.

    - `locale`
      A [locale](#supported_locales) to display placeholders and error strings in.

Setting the locale does not affect the behavior of postal code validation—a valid postal code for the billing country of the card is still required.

To indicate the direction of text for *right to left* languages such as Arabic and Hebrew, mount Elements underneath an HTML element that includes the `dir="rtl"` attribute.
    - `mode`
      Required to use with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md) and [Express Checkout Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/express-checkout-element.md).

The minimum amount is 0.50 USD or [equivalent in charge currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies.md#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts). If `mode` is `subscription`, the value supports 0 to account for coupons and free trials, but any amount above 0 is subject to the minimum.

### Example

## useStripe hook

The `useStripe` hook returns the initialized [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js/initializing.md) instance from the `Elements` provider.
Use it to [confirm payments](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment.md) and call other Stripe.js methods from inside
your React components.

If you need to access the Stripe object from a class component, use [ElementsConsumer](https://docs.stripe.com/react_stripe_js/elements/elements_consumer.md) instead.

### Return value

- `result`
  Returns the `Stripe` instance configured on the [provider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements/elements_provider.md), or `null` while it is still loading.

### Example

```title
Call useStripe
```

## useElements

To safely pass the payment information collected by the Payment Element to the Stripe API,
access the `Elements` instance so that you can use it with `stripe.confirmPayment`.

If you need to access an Element from a class component, use [ElementsConsumer](https://docs.stripe.com/react_stripe_js/elements/elements_consumer.md) instead.

### Return value

- `result`
  Returns the current `Elements` instance or `null` while the provider is still loading.

### Example

```title
Call useElements
```

## ElementsConsumer

`ElementsConsumer` exposes the same `Stripe` and `Elements` instances as the [hooks](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements/use_stripe.md), but uses a render
prop instead of React hooks. This is useful when building class components or when you prefer the
render-prop pattern.

### Props

- `children`
  A render prop that receives `{stripe, elements}`. Render your UI using these instances.

### Example

```title
Render ElementsConsumer
```

## PaymentElement

Use the `PaymentElement` from `@stripe/react-stripe-js` to collect payment details for more
 than [40 payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods/integration-options.md) from around the globe.

The component must be rendered inside an [Elements Provider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/elements/elements_provider.md).

      - `type`
        Defines the layout to render the Payment Element.
      - `defaultCollapsed`

        - `payto`
          - `usePayId`
            When `true`, the PayTo payment method will default to showing the PayID input instead of BSB/account number fields. Customers can still switch between PayID and BSB/account number using the toggle link.
      - `card`
        Specify default settings for card payments.
        - `network`

You can override the default order in which payment methods are displayed in the Payment Element with a list of payment method types.

If the associated PaymentIntent has payment method types not specified in `paymentMethodOrder`, they will be displayed
after the payment methods you specify. If you specify payment method types not on the associated PaymentIntent, they will be ignored.
    - `fields`
      By default, the Payment Element collects all necessary details to complete a payment.

For some payment methods, the Payment Element collects details such as name or email
that you might have already collected from the customer. If this is the case, you can prevent the Payment Element
from collecting these details by using the `fields` option.

If you disable collecting certain fields
with the `fields` option, you must pass that same data to [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment.md)
or we'll reject the payment.

Learn how to [customize the billing details to collect](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/control-billing-details-collection.md) and
the [customized fields](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-customized_fields).
      - `billingDetails`
        Specify `never` to avoid collecting all [billing details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object.md#payment_method_object-billing_details)
in the Payment Element. If you would like to disable only certain billing details,
pass an object specifying which fields you would like to disable collection for.
The default setting for each field or object is `auto`.
        - `name`
        - `email`
          Specify `never` to avoid collecting email in the Payment Element.

Note that this parameter is independent of [walletOptions](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-options-walletOptions), so if you set `fields.billingDetails.email=never` and `walletOptions.emailRequired=true`, email is still collected from wallets.
        - `phone`
          Specify `never` to avoid collecting phone in the Payment Element.

Note that this parameter is independent of [walletOptions](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element.md#payment_element_create-options-walletOptions), so if you set `fields.billingDetails.phone=never` and `walletOptions.phoneNumberRequired=true`, phone is still collected from wallets.
        - `address`
          Specify `if_required` to only collect the minimum billing address fields required to complete the payment.
You can omit and hide optional address fields in the card form, such as country and postal code.
Unlike the `never` option, you don't need to include fields omitted in the Payment Element when confirming the payment.
This can reduce the amount of information required to complete the form.

Disabling address collection can negatively impact authorization rates and network fees for users on a network cost plus pricing plan.
          - `line1`
          - `line2`
          - `city`
            The name of a city, town, village, etc.
          - `state`
            The most coarse subdivision of a country.
Depending on the country, this might correspond to a state, a province, an oblast, a prefecture, or something else along these lines.
          - `country`
            Two-letter country code, capitalized. Valid two-letter country codes are specified by ISO3166 alpha-2.
          - `postalCode`
            The postal code or ZIP code, also known as PIN code in India.
    - `readOnly`
      Applies a read-only state to the Payment Element so that payment details can’t be changed. Default is false.

Enabling the `readOnly` option doesn't change the Payment Element's visual appearance. If you want to adjust the way the Payment Element looks, use the [Appearance API](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api.md).
    - `terms`
      Control how mandates or other legal agreements are displayed in the Payment Element.
Use `never` to never display legal agreements. The default setting is `auto`, which causes
legal agreements to only be shown when necessary.

Consult your legal and compliance advisors before making any changes to the text of mandates or legal agreements. You can't use the `terms` option to violate obligations under your Stripe agreement, Stripe policies, applicable laws or scheme rules.

      - `paypal`
      - `sepaDebit`
      - `sofort`
      - `usBankAccount`
    - `wallets`
      By default, the Payment Element will display all the payment
methods that the underlying Payment Intent was created with.

However, wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay are not payment
methods per the Payment Intent API. They will show when the
Payment Intent has the `card` payment method and the customer is
using a supported platform and have an active card in their
account.  This is the `auto` behavior, and it is the default for
choice for all wallets.

If you do not want to show a given wallet as a payment option, you
can set its property in `wallets` to `never`.
      - `applePay`
      - `googlePay`

        Collect the customer's email from wallet payment methods by setting this option to true.
      - `phoneNumberRequired`
        Collect the customer's phone number from wallet payment methods by setting this option to true.

PayPal doesn't provide a phone number, even when this option is set to true.

Google Pay makes a best effort to return the phone number registered to the wallet, but doesn't guarantee it will be provided in all cases.

Link makes a best effort to return the phone number registered to the wallet, but doesn't guarantee it will be provided in all cases.

- If you pass `allowedShippingCountries`, `phoneNumberRequired`, `shippingAddressRequired`, `emailRequired`, `applePay`, `lineItems`, or `business` when creating the Express Checkout Element, `billingAddressRequired` defaults to false.
- Otherwise, `billingAddressRequired` defaults to true.

You can explicitly set `billingAddressRequired` to true or false to override the default behavior.

We highly recommend that you collect the billing address because it can be used to perform address verifications and block fraudulent payments.
    - `business`
      Provide information about your business that's displayed in the Express Checkout Element.
This information will be retrieved from your Stripe account if it's not provided.
      - `name`
        The name of your business. Your business name is used to signal to the customer who they're paying.

Klarna always retrieves the business name from your Stripe account, even when this option is set.

You can override this to specify a custom button height in the range of 40px-55px.
    - `buttonTheme`
      Specify the preferred button theme to use. By default, Elements determines the themes based on the specified [appearance option](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create.md#stripe_elements-options-appearance).

    - `emailRequired`
      Collect the customer's email by setting this option to `true`.
    - `layout`
      Specify how the buttons are arranged in a grid-like layout in the Express Checkout Element.
Elements determines the layout by using certain factors, such as available space, number of buttons, and the defined `layout` object.
      - `maxColumns`

        Defines the maximum number of rows the Express Checkout Element can use to render. Default is `0`, meaning unlimited.
      - `overflow`
        Specify whether or not to always hide the overflow menu or allow Elements to determine when to show the overflow menu. Default is `auto`.
You can't specify both `overflow: 'never'` and set `maxRows` to a number greater than 0.

methods possible as a result of your Dashboard configuration. This is the `auto` behavior.

If you don't want to show a given payment method as a payment option, set its
property in `paymentMethods` to `never`.
      - `amazonPay`
      - `applePay`
        Apple Pay has additional configurations
that determine when Stripe can show it. By default, Apple Pay shows when the customer
is using a supported platform and when we determine it's advantageous for your conversion.
This is the `auto` behavior.

If you want to always show Apple Pay when the customer is using a supported platform,
you can set its property in `paymentMethods` to `always`. This causes Apple Pay to be shown in supported browsers even when the customer
isn't logged in to Apple Pay, resulting in a sign-in flow.

Apple Pay on non-Safari desktop browsers is only supported when its property in `paymentMethods` is set to `always`.
      - `googlePay`
        Google Pay has additional configurations
that determine when Stripe can show it. By default, Google Pay shows when the customer
is using a supported platform and when we determine it's advantageous for your conversion.
This is the `auto` behavior.

If you want to always show Google Pay when the customer is using a supported platform,
you can set its property in `paymentMethods` to `always`. This causes Google Pay to be shown in supported browsers even when the customer
isn't logged in to Google Pay, resulting in a sign-in flow.
      - `link`
      - `paypal`
      - `klarna`
    - `paymentMethodOrder`
      By default, the Express Checkout Element uses a dynamic ordering that optimizes payment method display for each user.

You can override the default order in which payment methods display in the Express Checkout Element with a list of payment method types.

If there are payment methods that will show that are not specified in `paymentMethodOrder`, they display after the payment methods you specify. If you specify payment methods that will not show, they are ignored.
    - `phoneNumberRequired`
      Collect the customer's phone number by setting this option to `true`.

PayPal doesn't provide a phone number, even when this option is set to `true`.

Google Pay makes a best effort to return the phone number registered to the wallet, but doesn't guarantee it will be provided in all cases.
    - `shippingAddressRequired`
      Collect the customer's shipping address by setting this option to `true`.

If `true`, you must also supply a valid `shippingRates` option in either the `create`, `click`, or `shippingaddresschange` events.
    - `shippingRates`
      An array of ShippingRate objects. The first shipping rate listed appears in the payment interface as the default option.

        Unique identifier for the object.
      - `amount`
        The amount to charge for shipping.
      - `displayName`

          - `unit`
            A unit of time.
          - `value`
            Must be greater than 0.
        - `minimum`
          The lower bound of the estimated range. If empty, it represents no lower bound.
          - `unit`
            A unit of time.
          - `value`
            Must be greater than 0.

- `onConfirm`
  The [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/express_checkout_element_confirm_event.md) event is triggered from an Express Checkout Element when the customer finalizes their payment.

- `onClick`
  The [click](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/express_checkout_element_click_event.md) event is triggered from an Express Checkout Element when the customer clicks a payment button.

- `onCancel`
  The `cancel` event is triggered from an Express Checkout Element when the payment interface is dismissed.

Note that in some browsers, the payment interface might be dismissed by the customer even after they authorize the payment.
This means that you might receive a `cancel` event after receiving a `confirm` event.
If you're using the `cancel` event as a hook for canceling the customer's order, make sure you also refund the payment that you just created.

- `onShippingAddressChange`
  Triggered when a customer changes their shipping address.

- `onShippingRateChange`
  Triggered when a customer changes their shipping rate.

## Payment Intents

Accept global payments online with the [Payment Intents APIs](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents.md).
For step-by-step instructions on using the Payment Intents APIs, see the [accept a payment guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md).

The following Stripe.js methods are available to use as part of your integration.

## Confirm a payment

`stripe.confirmPayment(options: object)`

Use `stripe.confirmPayment` to confirm a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) using data collected
by the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/payment_element.md), or with manually provided data via `confirmParams`.
When called, `stripe.confirmPayment` will attempt to complete any [required actions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/intents.md),
such as authenticating your user by displaying a 3DS dialog or redirecting them to a bank authorization page.
Your user will be redirected to the `return_url` you pass once the confirmation is complete.

> The `stripe.confirmPayment` might take several seconds to complete.
> During that time, disable your form from being resubmitted and show a waiting indicator, such as a spinner. If you receive an error result, show this error to the user, re-enable the form, and hide the waiting indicator.

- `options`
    - `elements`
      The [Elements](#payment_element_create) instance used to create the Payment Element.

Required if you [collect payment details before creating an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred.md?platform=web&type=payment). It's always required if you don't provide a `clientSecret`.
    - `clientSecret`
      The PaymentIntent's client secret.

Required if you [collect payment details before creating an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred.md?platform=web&type=payment). It's always required if you don't provide an `elements` instance containing a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret).
    - `confirmParams`
      Parameters that will be passed on to the Stripe API. You can also use the parameters from the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md), except for setup_future_usage.
      - `return_url`
        The URL that Stripe redirects your customer to after they complete the payment.

You can use the following query parameters, `payment_intent` (the PaymentIntent's ID) or `payment_intent_client_secret` (the PaymentIntent's client secret), to retrieve the PaymentIntent's [status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-status). When Stripe redirects your customer, the resulting URL has these query parameters appended. You can also append your own query parameters to the `return_url`, which persist through the redirect process.

If you don't want to redirect for card payments after payment completion, set [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment.md#confirm_payment_intent-options-redirect) to `if_required`.
      - `shipping`
        The [shipping details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md#confirm_payment_intent-shipping) for the payment, if collected.

**Note**: When the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/address_element.md) in shipping mode is being used, shipping address details are collected from the Address Element and passed
to the PaymentIntents [confirm endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md) as the [shipping](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md#confirm_payment_intent-shipping)
parameter.
You can also include additional `shipping` fields, which will be merged with the data collected from the Element.
Values passed here will override details collected by Elements.
      - `confirmation_token`
        If collected previously, the ID of the ConfirmationToken to use to confirm this PaymentIntent. This is mutually exclusive with the `elements` parameter.
      - `payment_method`
        If collected previously, the ID of the payment method to attach to this PaymentIntent. This is mutually exclusive with the `elements` parameter.
      - `payment_method_data`
        When you call `stripe.confirmPayment`, payment details are collected from the Element and passed to the PaymentIntents
[confirm endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md) as the [payment_method_data](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md#confirm_payment_intent-payment_method_data)
parameter. You can also include additional `payment_method_data` fields, which will be merged with the data collected from the Element.
        - `billing_details`
          The customer's [billing_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/create.md#create_payment_method-billing_details).
Details collected by Elements will override values passed here.
Billing fields that are omitted in the Payment Element via the `fields` option required.

**Note**: When the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/address_element.md) in billing mode is being used, billing address details are collected from the Address Element and passed
to the PaymentIntents [confirm endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md) as the [billing_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/create.md#create_payment_method-billing_details)
parameter. The values collected from the Address Element will take precedence.
        - `allow_redisplay`
          Indicates whether the payment method can be displayed to the customer in subsequent checkout flows. The value passed here will override the [allow_redisplay](docs/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-allow_redisplay) determined by the provided `elements` parameter.
      - `expand`
        An array of pass through [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md) expansion parameters ([learn more](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects.md)).
    - `redirect`
      By default, `stripe.confirmPayment` will always redirect to your `return_url` after a successful confirmation.
If you set `redirect: "if_required"`, then `stripe.confirmPayment` will only redirect if your user chooses a redirect-based payment method.

**Note**: Setting `if_required` requires that you handle successful confirmations for redirect-based and non-redirect based payment methods separately.
When a non-redirect based payment method is successfully confirmed, `stripe.confirmPayment` will resolve with a `{paymentIntent}` object.

### Example

```title
Confirm a payment intent
```

## Confirm a PaymentIntent by payment method

Below are a number of methods used to confirm a PaymentIntent for a specific payment method type.

## Confirm a card payment

`stripe.confirmCardPayment(clientSecret: string, data?: object, options?: object)`

Use `stripe.confirmCardPayment` when the customer submits your payment form.
When called, it will confirm the [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) with `data` you provide and carry out 3DS or other next actions if they are required.

If you are using [Dynamic 3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure.md#three-ds-radar), `stripe.confirmCardPayment` will trigger your Radar rules to execute and may open a dialog for your customer to authenticate their payment.

When you confirm a `PaymentIntent`, it needs to have an attached [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods.md).
In addition to confirming the `PaymentIntent`, this method can automatically create and attach a new `PaymentMethod` for you.
It can also be called with an existing `PaymentMethod`, or if you have already attached a `PaymentMethod` you can call this method without needing to provide any additional data.
These use cases are detailed in the sections that follow.

> Note that `stripe.confirmCardPayment` may take several seconds to complete.
> During that time, you should disable your form from being resubmitted and show a waiting indicator like a spinner.
> If you receive an error result, you should be sure to show that error to the customer, re-enable the form, and hide the waiting indicator.
> 
> Additionally, `stripe.confirmCardPayment` may trigger a [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure.md) authentication challenge.
> This will be shown in a modal dialog and may be confusing for customers using assistive technologies like screen readers.
> You should make your form accessible by ensuring that success or error messages are clearly read out after this method completes.

- `clientSecret`
  The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent`.

- `data`
  Data to be sent with the request.
Refer to the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md) for a full list of parameters.
    - `payment_method`
      Either the `id` of an existing [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods.md), or an object containing data to create a `PaymentMethod` with.
See the use case sections below for details.
    - `shipping`
      The [shipping details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md#confirm_payment_intent-shipping) for the payment, if collected.
    - `return_url`
      If you are [handling next actions yourself](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status.md#next-actions), pass in a `return_url`.
If the subsequent action is `redirect_to_url`, this URL will be used on the return path for the redirect.
    - `receipt_email`
      Email address that the receipt for the resulting payment will be sent to.
    - `setup_future_usage`
      Indicates that you intend to make future payments with this PaymentIntent's payment method.

If present, the payment method used with this PaymentIntent can be [attached to a Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/attach.md), even after the transaction completes.

Use `on_session` if you intend to only reuse the payment method when your customer is present in your checkout flow.
Use `off_session` if your customer may or may not be in your checkout flow.
See [saving card details during payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment.md) to learn more.

Stripe uses `setup_future_usage` to dynamically optimize your payment flow and comply with regional legislation and network rules.
For example, if your customer is impacted by [SCA](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication.md), using `off_session` will ensure that they are authenticated while processing this PaymentIntent.
You will then be able to collect [off-session payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards/charging-saved-cards.md#off-session-payments-with-saved-cards) for this customer.
    - `payment_method_options`
      An object containing payment-method-specific configuration to confirm the [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) with.
      - `card`
        Configuration for this card payment.
        - `cvc`
          Use the provided `cardCvc` [Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element.md) when confirming the PaymentIntent with an existing PaymentMethod.
        - `network`
          Selected network to process this PaymentIntent on. Depends on the [available networks](https://docs.stripe.com/card-brand-choice.md#identifying-the-available-card-networks) of the card attached to the PaymentIntent. Can only be set at confirm-time.

- `options`
  An options object to control the behavior of this method.
    - `handleActions`
      Set this to `false` if you want to [handle next actions yourself](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status.md#next-actions), or if you want to defer next action handling until later (e.g. for use in the [PaymentRequest API](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button.md#complete-payment-intents)).
Default is `true`.

Refer to our [integration guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment.md) for more details.

Since the [Customer Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance.md) payment method draws from a balance, the attempt will succeed or fail depending on the current balance amount.
To collect more funds from the customer when the cash balance is insufficient, use the customer balance with [bank transfer funding](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment.md) parameters.

The confirmation attempt will finish in one of the following result states:

2. If the customer balance is less than the amount, and you do not set the `funding_type`, the PaymentIntent response will have a `status` of `requires_payment_method`.
3. If the customer balance is less than the amount, and you set the `funding_type`, the PaymentIntent response will have a `status` of `requires_action`. The `paymentIntent.next_action.display_bank_transfer_instructions` hash will contain bank transfer details for funding the [Customer Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance.md).

## Setup Intents

Use the [Setup Intents APIs](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents.md) to save a card and charge it later.
For step-by-step instructions on using the Setup Intents APIs, see the [set up recurring payments guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse.md).

The following Stripe.js methods are available for working with Setup Intents.

## Confirm a setup

`stripe.confirmSetup(options: object)`

Use `stripe.confirmSetup` to confirm a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents.md) using data collected
by the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/payment_element.md), or with manually provided data via `confirmParams`.
When called, `stripe.confirmSetup` will attempt to complete any [required actions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/intents.md),
such as authenticating your user by displaying a 3DS dialog or redirecting them to a bank authorization page.
Your user will be redirected to the `return_url` you pass once the authorization is complete.

> The `stripe.confirmSetup` might take several seconds to complete.
> During that time, disable your form from being resubmitted and show a waiting indicator, such as a spinner. If you receive an error result, show this error to the user, re-enable the form, and hide the waiting indicator.

- `options`
    - `elements`
      The [Elements](#payment_element_create) instance used to create the Payment Element.

Required if you [collect payment details before creating an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred.md?platform=web&type=setup). It's always required if you don't provide a `clientSecret`.
    - `clientSecret`
      The SetupIntent's client secret.

Required if you [collect payment details before creating an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred.md?platform=web&type=setup). It's always required if you don't provide an `elements` instance containing a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/object.md#setup_intent_object-client_secret).
    - `confirmParams`
      Parameters that will be passed on to the Stripe API. Refer to the [Setup Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/confirm.md) for a full list of parameters.
      - `return_url`
        The URL that Stripe redirects your customer to after they complete authentication.
      - `confirmation_token`
        If collected previously, the ID of the ConfirmationToken to use to confirm this SetupIntent. This is mutually exclusive with the `elements` parameter.
      - `payment_method_data`
        When you call `stripe.confirmSetup`, payment details are collected from the Element and passed to the SetupIntents
[confirm endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/confirm.md) as the [payment_method_data](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/confirm.md#confirm_setup_intent-payment_method)
parameter. You can also include additional `payment_method_data` fields, which will be merged with the data collected from the Element.
        - `billing_details`
          The customer's [billing_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/create.md#create_payment_method-billing_details).
Details collected by Elements will override values passed here.
Billing fields that are omitted in the Payment Element via the `fields` option required.
        - `allow_redisplay`
          Indicates whether the payment method can be displayed to the customer in subsequent checkout flows. The value passed here will override the [allow_redisplay](docs/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-allow_redisplay) determined by the provided `elements` parameter.
      - `expand`
        An array of pass through [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/object.md) expansion parameters ([learn more](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects.md)).
    - `redirect`
      By default, `stripe.confirmSetup` will always redirect to your `return_url` after a successful confirmation.
If you set `redirect: "if_required"`, then `stripe.confirmSetup` will only redirect if your user chooses a redirect-based payment method.

**Note**: Setting `if_required` requires that you handle successful confirmations for redirect-based and non-redirect based payment methods separately.
When a non-redirect based payment method is successfully confirmed, `stripe.confirmSetup` will resolve with a `{setupIntent}` object.

### Example

```title
Confirm a setup intent
```

## Confirm a SetupIntent by payment method

Below are a number of methods used to confirm a SetupIntent for a specific payment method type.

## Confirm card setup

`stripe.confirmCardSetup(clientSecret: string, data?: object, options?: object)`

Use `stripe.confirmCardSetup` in the [Setup Intents API flow](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse.md) when the customer submits your payment form.
When called, it will confirm the [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents.md) with `data` you provide and carry out 3DS or other next actions if they are required.

When you confirm a `SetupIntent`, it needs to have an attached [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods.md).
In addition to confirming the `SetupIntent`, this method can automatically create and attach a new `PaymentMethod` for you.
It can also be called with an existing `PaymentMethod`, or if you have already attached a `PaymentMethod` you can call this method without needing to provide any additional data.
These use cases are detailed in the sections that follow.

> Note that `stripe.confirmCardSetup` may take several seconds to complete.
> During that time, you should disable your form from being resubmitted and show a waiting indicator like a spinner.
> If you receive an error result, you should be sure to show that error to the customer, re-enable the form, and hide the waiting indicator.
> 
> Additionally, `stripe.confirmCardSetup` may trigger a [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure.md) authentication challenge.
> This will be shown in a modal dialog and may be confusing for customers using assistive technologies like screen readers.
> You should make your form accessible by ensuring that success or error messages are clearly read out after this method completes.

- `clientSecret`
  The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/object.md#setup_intent_object-client_secret) of the `SetupIntent`.

- `data`
  Data to be sent with the request.
Refer to the [Setup Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/confirm.md) for a full list of parameters.
    - `payment_method`
      Either the `id` of an existing [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods.md), or an object containing data to create a `PaymentMethod` with.
See the use case sections below for details.
    - `return_url`
      If you are [handling next actions yourself](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status.md#next-actions), pass in a `return_url`.
If the subsequent action is `redirect_to_url`, this URL will be used on the return path for the redirect.

- `options`
  An options object to control the behavior of this method.
    - `handleActions`
      Set this to `false` if you want to [handle next actions yourself](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status.md#next-actions), or if you want to defer next action handling until later (e.g. for use in the [PaymentRequest API](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button.md#complete-payment-intents)).
Default is `true`.

## The Payment Request object

A `PaymentRequest` object is used to collect payment information through an interface controlled and styled by the browser itself (i.e., not by you or your page).

See the [Payment Request Button Element quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button.md) for a high-level overview of when you’d want to do this.

## Create a PaymentRequestObject

`stripe.paymentRequest(options: object)`

Use `stripe.paymentRequest` to create a `PaymentRequest` object.
Creating a `PaymentRequest` requires that you configure it with an `options` object.

In Safari, `stripe.paymentRequest` uses Apple Pay, and in other browsers it uses the [Payment Request API standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/).

> `stripe.paymentRequest` abstracts over a number of implementation

- `options`
  A set of options to create this `PaymentRequest` instance with.
These options can be updated using [`paymentRequest.update`](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_request/update.md).
    - `country`
      The two-letter country code of your Stripe account (e.g., `US`).
    - `currency`
      Three character currency code (e.g., `usd`).
    - `total`
      A [PaymentItem](#payment_item_object) object.
This `PaymentItem` is shown to the customer in the browser’s payment interface.
    - `displayItems`
      An array of [PaymentItem](#payment_item_object) objects.
These objects are shown as line items in the browser’s payment interface.
Note that the sum of the line item amounts does not need to add up to the `total` amount above.
    - `requestPayerName`
      By default, the browser‘s payment interface only asks the customer for actual payment information.
A customer name can be collected by setting this option to `true`.
This collected name will appears in the [PaymentResponse](https://docs.stripe.com/js/appendix/payment_response.md) object.

We highly recommend you collect name as this also results in collection of billing address for Apple Pay.
The billing address can be used to perform address verification and block fraudulent payments.
For all other payment methods, the billing address is automatically collected when available.
    - `requestPayerEmail`
      See the [`requestPayerName`](#payment_request_create-options-requestPayerName) option.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves with an object detailing if an
enabled wallet is ready to pay. If no wallet is available, it
resolves with `null`. The resolution object has the properties
in the table below.

**NOTE**: The `paymentRequestButton` element automatically shows the correct wallet branding.
You shouldn't need to inspect the return object's properties unless you are building your own custom button.

> `canMakePayment` resolves to `null` outside the following supported cases:
> 
> * Safari 10.1+ (desktop and mobile)
>   * with a saved Apple Pay card
>   * or when in a Private Browsing window
>   * or when the “Allow websites to check if Apple Pay is set up” preference is disabled

## PaymentRequest events

`PaymentRequest` instances emit several different types of events.

## Token event

`paymentRequest.on(event: string, handler: function)`

Stripe.js automatically creates a [Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens.md) after the customer is done interacting with the browser’s payment interface.
To access the created `Token`, listen for this event.

- `event`
  The name of the event. In this case, `token`.

- `handler`
  A callback function that will be called with a [PaymentResponse](https://docs.stripe.com/js/appendix/payment_response.md) object when the event is fired.
The `PaymentResponse` object will contain a `token` field.

### Example

```title
Handle 'token' event
```

## PaymentMethod event

`paymentRequest.on(event: string, handler: function)`

Stripe.js automatically creates a [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods.md) after the customer is done interacting with the browser’s payment interface.
To access the created `PaymentMethod`, listen for this event.

- `event`
  The name of the event. In this case, `paymentmethod`.

- `handler`
  A callback function that will be called with a [PaymentResponse](https://docs.stripe.com/js/appendix/payment_response.md) object when the event is fired.
The `PaymentResponse` object will contain a `paymentMethod` field.

### Example

```title
Handle 'paymentmethod' event
```

## Source event

`paymentRequest.on(event: string, handler: function)`

Stripe.js automatically creates a [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sources.md) after the customer is done interacting with the browser’s payment interface.
To access the created source, listen for this event.

- `event`
  The name of the event. In this case, `source`.

### Example

```title
Handle 'source' event
```

## Cancel event

`paymentRequest.on(event: string, handler: function)`

The `cancel` event is emitted from a [PaymentRequest](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_request.md) when the browser‘s payment interface is dismissed.

Note that in some browsers, the payment interface may be dismissed by the customer even after they authorize the payment.
This means that you may receive a `cancel` event on your PaymentRequest object after receiving a `token`, `paymentmethod`, or `source` event.
If you’re using the `cancel` event as a hook for canceling the customer’s order, make sure you also refund the payment that you just created.

- `event`
  The name of the event.
In this case, `cancel`.

- `event`
  The name of the event. In this case, `shippingaddresschange`.

- `handler`
  `handler(event) => void` is a **callback function** that you provide that will be called when the event is fired.

When called it will be passed an event object with the following properties:
    - `updateWith`
      `updateWith(updateDetails) => void` is a Stripe.js provided function that is called with an [UpdateDetails](https://docs.stripe.com/js/appendix/update_details.md) object to merge your updates into the current `PaymentRequest` object.
Note that if you subscribe to `shippingaddresschange` events, then you must call `updateWith` within 30 seconds.
    - `shippingAddress`
      The customer's selected shipping address.

To maintain privacy, browsers may anonymize the shipping address by removing sensitive information that is not necessary to calculate shipping costs.
Depending on the country, some fields can be missing or partially redacted.
For example, the shipping address in the U.S. may only contain a city, state, and ZIP code.
The full shipping address appears in the [PaymentResponse](https://docs.stripe.com/js/appendix/payment_response.md) object after the purchase is confirmed in the browser’s payment interface

## Confirmation Tokens

ConfirmationTokens transport client-side data collected by Stripe.js to your server. You can use them to confirm a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent on your server.

## Create a ConfirmationToken with Elements

`stripe.createConfirmationToken(options: object)`

Convert payment information collected by Elements into a [ConfirmationToken](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens.md) object.

Use this method if you want to [confirm payment on your server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server.md) or [confirm payment on a subsequent page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation.md).

- `options`
    - `elements`
      The [Elements](#payment_element_create) instance that was used to create the Express Checkout Element or Payment Element. Calling `stripe.createConfirmationToken` pulls payment method, billing address, and shipping address data from the Elements instance.
    - `params`
      Parameters that will be passed on to the Stripe API.
      - `payment_method_data`
        When you call `stripe.createConfirmationToken`, payment details are collected from Elements.
You can include additional `payment_method_data` fields, which will be merged with the data collected from Elements.
Refer to the [PaymentMethod API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/create.md) for a full list of parameters.
        - `billing_details`
          [Billing information](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/create.md#create_payment_method-billing_details) associated with the PaymentMethod that may be used or required by particular types of payment methods.
        - `allow_redisplay`
          Indicates whether the payment method can be displayed to the customer in subsequent checkout flows. The value passed here will override the [allow_redisplay](docs/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-allow_redisplay) determined by the provided `elements` parameter.
      - `shipping`
        The [shipping details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-shipping) for the payment, if collected. You can't specify `shipping` if `mode: 'setup'` is specified on the `elements` object.

**Note**: When the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/address_element.md) in shipping mode is being used, shipping address details are collected from the Address Element. You can also include additional `shipping` fields, which will be merged with the data collected from the Element, overriding any fields that were also collected by the Address Element.
      - `return_url`
        The URL to redirect your customer back to after they authenticate or cancel their payment on the payment method's app or site.
If you'd prefer to redirect to a mobile application, you can alternatively supply an application URI scheme.
This parameter is only used for cards and other redirect-based payment methods.
      - `metadata`
        Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata.md) that you can attach to the ConfirmationToken. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.

Note that the metadata is saved on the Confirmation Token object but isn't returned in the [frontend response](https://docs.stripe.com/metadata.md#requests). You can retrieve the metadata on the server with a [retrieve confirmation token request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens/retrieve.md).

### Example

```title
Create a ConfirmationToken
```

## Payment Methods

PaymentMethod objects represent your customer's payment instruments. They can be used with PaymentIntents to collect payments or saved to Customer objects to store instrument details for future payments.

### Example

```title
Create a PaymentMethod
```

## Create a PaymentMethod with Elements

`stripe.createPaymentMethod(options: object)`

Use `stripe.createPaymentMethod` to convert payment information collected by elements into a [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods.md) object that you safely pass to your server to use in an API call.

**NOTE:** In most integrations, you will not need to use this method. Instead, use methods like [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment.md), which will automatically create a PaymentMethod when you confirm a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md).

- `options`

Create a PaymentMethod
```

## Tokens

Stripe uses tokens to collect sensitive client information without exposing it. When you use the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents.md), the client handles tokenization and you don't have to create tokens yourself.

Stripe.js provides the following method to create [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens.md).

## Create a Token

`stripe.createToken(tokenType: string, data?: object)`

## Show verification modal

`stripe.verifyIdentity(clientSecret: string)`

Use `stripe.verifyIdentity` to display an [Identity](https://docs.stripe.com/identity.md) modal that securely collects verification information.

- `clientSecret`
  The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object.md#identity_verification_session_object-client_secret) of the `VerificationSession`.

### Example

```title
Show verification modal
```

## Retrieve card networks

In order to comply with [co-badged cards compliance](https://docs.stripe.com/co-badged-cards-compliance), eligible businesses must honor customers’ card brand choice for co-badged cards.

Stripe-hosted UIs, such as [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links), and [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), can automatically display a network selector when you meet the elgibility criteria. You can migrate to a Stripe-hosted UI to use these features.

If you instead maintain a [custom checkout integration](https://docs.stripe.com/co-badged-cards-compliance?type=custom-integration#integration-guides) and [have access to raw card data APIs](https://support.stripe.com/questions/enabling-access-to-raw-card-data-apis), Stripe provides the following method to identify available networks for customer card numbers.

## Retrieve card networks

`stripe.retrieveCardNetworks(rawCardNumber: string)`

Used in [custom integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/co-badged-cards-compliance?type=custom-integration) to support co-badged card compliance.

Stripe-hosted UIs, such as [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links), and [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), will automatically display a network selector when you meet the [applicability criteria](https://docs.stripe.com/co-badged-cards-compliance?type=custom-integration#when-regulation-applies), if configured properly. You can migrate to a Stripe-hosted UI to use these features.

- `rawCardNumber`
  The card number entered in your card collection form. When passed 8 or more digits of the card number, the method starts returning available networks for the card.

In order to pass these card details to Stripe, you must [have access to raw card data APIs](https://support.stripe.com/questions/enabling-access-to-raw-card-data-apis).

### Example

```title
Retrieve card networks
```

## Supported browsers


Stripe.js strives to support all recent versions of major browsers. For the sake of security and providing the best experience to the majority of customers, we do not support browsers that are no longer receiving security updates and represent a small minority of traffic. We support some older versions of evergreen browsers but recommend merchants keep their systems up to date for the best support.
We support the following desktop browser versions:

* Chrome 38+
* Safari 10.1+
* Firefox 29+
* Edge 15+
* Opera 25+

We support the following mobile browsers:
* iOS Safari 9+ and other browsers and web views which use the system-provided WebKit engine
* Android Chrome 38+
* Samsung Browser 7.1+

For browsers not explicitly supported, we limit support as follows:
* We require TLS 1.2 to be supported by the browser.
* We require browsers that are sufficiently modern enough that they support [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) in the JavaScript programming language.
* We respond to bug reports but do not proactively test other browsers.

If you have an issue with Stripe.js on a specific browser, please [contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact) so we can improve its support.

## Cross-Origin Isolation


Currently, Stripe.js doesn't support [Cross-origin isolated sites](https://web.dev/articles/cross-origin-isolation-guide)

Cross-origin isolation requires support by all dependencies, and several key dependencies that enable our payment offerings don't yet provide support for this feature.

## Supported locales

The following subset of [IETF language tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) can be used to configure localization in Stripe.js.

## Viewport meta tag requirements

In order to provide a great user experience for 3D Secure on all devices,
you should set your page's viewport `width` to `device-width` with the
[viewport meta tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag).

There are several other viewport settings, and you can configure those
based on your needs. Just make sure you include `width=device-width`
somewhere in your configuration.

## Handle card payment with an Element

`stripe.handleCardPayment(clientSecret: string, element: Element, data?: object)`

*`handleCardPayment` has been renamed to [confirmCardPayment](#stripe_confirm_card_payment).
In addition to the rename, we have slightly modified the arguments.
These changes do not affect the behavior of the method.
While we have no plans to ever remove support for `handleCardPayment`, we think the new name and arguments are easier to understand and better convey what the method is doing.*

Use `stripe.handleCardPayment(clientSecret, element, data?)` when the customer submits your payment form.
It will gather payment information from the element, which can be a `card` or `cardNumber` element, along with any other data you provide.
It will then confirm the `PaymentIntent` and carry out 3DS or other `next_action`s if they are required.

If you are using [Dynamic 3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure.md#three-ds-radar), `handleCardPayment` will trigger your Radar rules to execute and may open a dialog for your customer to authenticate their payment.

> Note that `stripe.handleCardPayment` may take several seconds to complete.
> During that time, you should disable your form from being resubmitted and show a waiting indicator like a spinner.
> If you receive an error result, you should be sure to show that error to the customer, re-enable the form, and hide the waiting indicator.
> 
> Additionally, `stripe.handleCardPayment` may trigger a [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure.md) authentication challenge.
> This will be shown in a modal dialog and may be confusing for customers using assistive technologies like screen readers.
> You should make your form accessible by ensuring that success or error messages are clearly read out after this method completes.

- `clientSecret`
  The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent`.

- `element`
  A `card` or `cardNumber` [Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element.md) that will be used to create a payment method.

- `data`
  Data to be sent with the request.
    - `payment_method_data`
      Use this parameter to supply additional data relevant to the payment method, such as billing details.
      - `billing_details`
        The [billing details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/create.md#create_payment_method-billing_details) associated with the card.
    - `shipping`
      The [shipping details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md#confirm_payment_intent-shipping) for the payment, if collected.
    - `receipt_email`
      Email address that the receipt for the resulting payment will be sent to.
    - `setup_future_usage`
      Indicates that you intend to make future payments with this [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md)'s payment method.

If present, the `PaymentMethod` used with this PaymentIntent can be [attached to a Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/attach.md), even after the transaction completes.

Use `on_session` if you intend to only reuse the `PaymentMethod` when your customer is present in your checkout flow.
Use `off_session` if your customer may or may not be in your checkout flow.
See [saving card details during payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards/saving-cards-after-payment.md) to learn more.

Stripe uses `setup_future_usage` to dynamically optimize your payment flow and comply with regional legislation and network rules.
For example, if your customer is impacted by SCA, using `off_session` will ensure that they are authenticated while processing this PaymentIntent.
You will then be able to collect [off-session payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards/charging-saved-cards.md#off-session-payments-with-saved-cards) for this customer.

## Sources

The Sources API has been deprecated and replaced by the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents.md).

Stripe.js provides the following methods to create and retrieve [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sources.md), which are part of the Charges API.

## Create a Source

`stripe.createSource(element: object, sourceData: object)`

Use `stripe.createSource` to convert payment information collected by elements into a [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api.md#sources) object that you safely pass to your server to use in an API call.
See the [Sources documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/sources.md) for more information about sources.

- `element`
  The [Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element.md) containing payment information.
If applicable, the `Element` pulls data from other elements you’ve created on the same [Elements](#elements_create) instance.

- `sourceData`
  A required object containing the `type` of `Source` you want to create, and any additional payment information that you have collected.
See the [Sources API](https://docs.stripe.com/api.md#create_source) reference for details.

### Example

```title
Create a Source
```

## Create source

`stripe.createSource(sourceData: object)`

Use `stripe.createSource` to convert raw payment information into a [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api.md#sources) object that you can safely pass to your server for use in an API call.
See the [Sources documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/sources.md) for more information about sources.

> You cannot pass raw card information to `stripe.createSource(sourceData)`.
> Instead, you must gather card information in an Element and use [`stripe.createSource(element, sourceData)`](#stripe_create_source).
> You can also pass an existing card token to convert it into a `Source` object.

- `sourceData`
  A required object containing the `type` of `Source` you want to create, and any additional payment information that you have collected.
See the [Sources API](https://docs.stripe.com/api.md#create_source) reference for details.

### Example

```title
Create a Source
```

## Retrieve a Source

`stripe.retrieveSource(source: object)`

Retrieve a [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api.md#sources) using its unique ID and client secret.

- `source`
  An object containing the unique ID and client secret for a `Source`.

You can use a `Source` object created with `stripe.createSource` as the argument to `stripe.retrieveSource`, as every `Source` object has both `id` and `client_secret` keys.
    - `id`
      Unique identifier of the `Source`.
    - `client_secret`
      A secret available to the web client that created the `Source`, for purposes of retrieving the `Source` later from that same client.

### Example

```title
Retrieve a Source
```
